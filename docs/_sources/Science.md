Why Science Matters
===================

## 25. Physics
-------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Everybody is told in school about mass, space, time and electric
    charge. But what are these things? How do we know they are real?

-   Why is there no coherent uncontested theory of everything which
    unites relativity with quantum mechanics

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   There was a time when science believed that the natural world made
    itself available to calculation and prediction. Scientific
    observation produced objectivity.[@wiener_human_1988]
    ![image](quantum.jpg)

-   Scientific facts were indisputable, and the scientific practices of
    physics became the blueprint for inquiry into society, economics,
    the arts and education.

-   Einstein's questions concerned the perception of scientists:
    perception was relative to light, space and time

-   In Quantum Mechanics observation was not only relative to the
    context in which it acts, but tied-up in the very structure of the
    natural world: observation changes the world.

-   Consequently, modern physics has become a process of accurately
    measuring uncertainties expressed as probabilities. This is what
    physicists are talking about when they talk about a 'wave function'.


## 26. Biology
-------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Which came first, the cell or DNA?

-   How does a molecule (DNA) come to be *about* another molecule?

-   What is the relationship between cells and atoms?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Life is cellular. But what is a cell? In school we learn that
    biology is a very different subject from physics. Biology concerns
    living processes, feedback, homeostasis, and so on. Physics concerns
    eternal mechanical laws. We accept that biological systems are made
    of atoms and molecules, but the connection between the processes of
    the mechanisms of atoms and molecules and the living processes of a
    growing embryo are shrouded in mystery.

    ![image](quantum_biology.jpg)

-   What would science look like if we saw biology and physics as one?
    The impact of Quantum mechanics on biological systems is exciting a
    lot of interest at the moment, as biological phenomena such as
    sensation are being successfully explained by Quantum phenomena.

-   DNA is a molecule which, biology tells us, is *about* other
    molecules. That means the molecules in DNA *refer to* the molecules
    in proteins which are expressed by it. How can a molecule be about
    another molecule? Where did that begin?

-   In both biology and physics there are a large number of basic things
    which we do not know. What happens at the quantum level? What is
    mass, time or space? Everyone talks about 'energy' - but what's
    that? Why is it that everything in nature appears to be meshed
    together - planets, plants, stars, man, consciousness?

-   Communication and information appear to be fundamental things at the
    subatomic level. Yet the real challenge here is that this subatomic
    level gives rise to our own biology and our own consciousness which
    in turn is able to think about its fundamental origins!


## 27. Deciding to Kill the Planet
---------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Are ecological problems the result of human failure to make good
    decisions?

-   How can humans make better decisions?

-   Why are humans so short-sighted in their development of new
    technologies?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   In the early 1970s, Cohen and March developed a model of
    organisational decision-making called the 'Garbage can model of
    organisational choice' [@cohen_garbage_1972]. This model described
    how humans rarely solve complex problems, but instead try to turn
    complex problems into easy problems by deciding to implement some
    technology which was already in existence. Cohen and March
    highlighted that this was often a cause of greater complexity and
    unmanageability.

-   When humans make decisions, either at an individual level, or at the
    level of corporations, governing bodies, ministerial agencies,
    political conferences, international agreements or pressure groups,
    brains come together to coordinate a collective course of action
    suitable for the group.

-   Damage persists upheld by webs of institutions, including
    universities, each seeking to uphold their identity and mission,
    including students who qualify from universities.

-   Decisions are made within constraints. There are the immediate
    constraints which include the available information about the
    situation, the skills and capabilities of individuals, psychology,
    technological resources, and communication channels for coordinating
    action.

-   More subtle constraints include power relations within the
    decision-making group and the broader political background of
    decision-making.

-   Decisions are made in an inter-subjective context, even when they
    are the decisions by an individual for their own needs. For example,
    students faced with choosing a subject or an institution must deal
    with multiple constraints, amongst which include information about
    judgements by others as to their suitability to a particular course,
    information about career prospects, information about alternatives,
    information about costs, as well as self-evaluation of desires,
    uncertainties, commitment and motivation.


## 28. Innovation and Scientific Advance
---------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Does innovation increase or decrease the complexity and uncertainty
    in society?

-   What is the relationship between human innovation and the ecosystem?

-   In what ways does one innovation lead to another?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   On one level, incremental improvement of technology works: today's
    cars are far better than the cars of the 1950s, aircraft rarely
    crash, and medical procedures which would have once been highly
    dangerous are now routine and safe. Technology evolves: it becomes
    more efficient, safer and cheaper.

-   However, developments in equity, freedom, social welfare, education
    and the prevention of conflict have not been so spectacular.

-   The technological gain of increased efficiency produce systematic
    problems elsewhere: cars turns the ground to tarmac, pollutes the
    air with fumes and noise, causes congestion, results in the
    travelling of increasing distances and creates a pathological
    obsession with speed.

-   A previous generation of fast cars creates new uncertainty which
    leads to the next generation of fast cars. The search for new
    medical procedures and drugs is a reaction to the uncertainty
    produced by the previous generation of drugs and procedures. The
    creation of new ways of measuring the performance of social systems
    a reaction to the failure of existing ways of measuring social
    systems.

## 29. Computers and Science
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Could scientists be replaced by computers?

-   What areas of scientific investigation do not involve computers?

-   Since computers manipulate information, what is information and how
    does it relate to science?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   After the advances in physics in the 20^th^ century, computers have
    become essential tools for calculating probabilities rather than
    definite objective observations.

-   By the 1940s, computers were being used to calculate the solutions
    to the statistical equations of Boltzmann and Gibbs: theoretical
    development could be accelerated with mechanical aids to
    computation.

-   In the years to the present day, the computer has transformed
    science to the point of dominating it. The sophistication of
    statistical analysis has been exploited in crunching ever-vaster
    amounts of data (such as the human genome) producing new patterns
    and descriptions which reveal new insights.

-   Computer-generated models appear to imitate nature displaying
    predictive power in their behaviour without any underlying
    hypothesis, and results of search routines upon the vast database of
    resources on the web can easily create the impression that the world
    *is* the internet.

-   This has led to an instrumentalisation of scientific inquiry.
    Advances in machine learning, off-the-shelf software for crunching
    social science data, modelling tools from engineering to biology
    create a scientific environment where inability to control the
    available software is a greater hindrance to professional success
    than the inability to think critically about what is being
    experienced.

## 30. DNA and Information
-------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   If DNA contains information, what is this information the same as
    information in a computer?

-   Do enzymes and proteins also contain information? How does this
    information relate to the information in DNA?

-   How do the cells at the end of the baby's finger know they are at
    the end of the finger? Does DNA tell them that?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Nobody knows what information is: there is no coherent definition
    which unites information in DNA with information in the computer, or
    information in physics.

-   Yet the sequencing of information in DNA and genetics is now a huge
    industry. Most of this work is dominated by large-scale
    computer-driven research. There are worries that this focus on
    computer-driven research will drive out the space for thinking or
    rethinking the way in which life works. In a recent article, Amos
    argues that the computer-dominated 'big science' is something we
    should all worry about because:

    > "genome sequencing offers little science training because most of
    > the work is done by machines and technicians ... it is the
    > antithesis of good science, being largely hypothesis-free and
    > involving little experimental design. Why are we placing our few
    > remaining publicly funded eggs into proportionately fewer and
    > fewer baskets?"[@noauthor_big_2013]

-   Utopian visions for the future of science envisage the
    ever-increasing power of machine learning and Big data producing
    answers to fundamental scientific and social problems. On closer
    inspection, the results of such massive computation, such as the
    analysis of genetic samples, or the analysis of human behaviour on
    social media, does little more than amplify the work of thousands of
    humans were they to endure the boredom of sitting around counting
    things.

## 31. Cellular Communication and Human Communication
----------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   Is there a relationship between the way cells talk to each other and
    the way we talk to each other

-   What is the relationship between cellular communication and physics?

-   What is the relationship between the cell and consciousness?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Cells communicate through a process whereby proteins are produced by
    DNA within the cell, and these proteins form receptors on the
    surface of the cell which connects to proteins in the environment of
    the cell, produced by other cells.

-   Cells organise themselves according to a balance between their
    internal organisation and their external environment. It is a
    process referred to in biology as 'transduction'

-   Drawn abstractly, a cell is a boundary which maintains itself
    through the balancing of communications within the boundary and
    communications outside the boundary
    ![image](cells.jpg)

-   Humans communicate similarly by organising themselves according the
    balance between the internal (psychological) environment and the
    external (social) environment.

-   If a cell communicates to maintain its boundary, do humans
    communicate to maintain their identity?

-   The extent to which human communication is an identity-preserving
    activity can be inspected by considering those things which most
    people do *not* want communicated (for example, secrets, things
    which reveal what we really think, but do not want to be known, etc)


## 32. Origin of Language - The 'Symbol Grounding Problem'
---------------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How can something as complex as human language emerge from something
    simple?

-   What hope is there for Artificial Intelligence if the complexity of
    language cannot be reproduced or explained?

-   When we say human language is 'complex', what do we mean?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   In the theory of information, the symbol grounding problem refers to
    the inability to account for the emergence of signs and tokens
    (words) with referents from basic principles without recourse to
    apriori distinctions.

-   The description of abstract mechanisms which show how structures of
    data can emerge and form the basis of very simple languages has been
    elusive, although there have been some interesting attempts by
    Holland (see his 'echo' model) and Floridi.
    ![image](symbolgrounding.jpg)

-   The symbol grounding problem is fundamentally a problem within the
    broader topic of morphogenesis, and indeed, the emergence of
    discrete symbols from basic principles is not dissimilar from the
    emergence of discrete forms from basic principles. They might well
    be one and the same!

-   Complexity itself is not well-understood. Human language has lots of
    variety - many words for many things. But human language also
    exhibits rich patterns, which appear to be overlaid over one
    another - like poetry.


## 33. Human Emotion and Behaviour
---------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   What is an emotion? How does it relate to a thought?

-   Why do certain things like music, football and grief give rise to
    such strong emotions?

-   Will machines ever experience emotions?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Emotions on listening to a piece of music, or emotions in watching a
    movie, or grieving after the death of a loved one are powerful
    whole-body sensations.

-   Emotions do not appear to be merely in the brain.

-   There appear to be connections between the waves of emotion that
    moves through a person on hearing a music, grieving for the death of
    a loved one, gazing into a lover's eyes, cheering at a football
    match, and so on.

-   Each effect, as a change to the state of a person, will have a
    consequent experience associated with it, and each state will
    therefore tend to move to another state. In moments of intense
    emotional experience, like bursting into tears, the physical effects
    of this rushing through us have real physical side-effects.

-   Phenomena like music are very important in understanding emotion.
    Recent research on 'communicative musicality' is examining the
    emotional and musical relationships between mothers and babies, for
    example [@malloch_communicative_2010]

-   In listening to music, emotion appears to be related to the problem
    of expectation[@huron_sweet_2008]. This is to say my expectations
    are normatively constructed, then the degree to which they might
    deviate from normal conditions may be an index of emotion.

## 34. Ecology and Evolution
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   Where have evolutionary processes actually been *observed*?

-   What is the difference between Darwinian evolution and creationism?

-   Do animals inherit the habits of their parents in their genes?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Bateson argues that "today it is quite obvious that [the organism]
    is not the unit of survival in the freal biological world. The unit
    of survival is organism plus environment. We are learning by bitter
    experience that the organism which destroys its environment destroys
    itself."

-   If the unit of survival of an organism is 'organism + environment',
    how are we to understand the environment?

-   Human development, if it is done in ignorance of the environment -
    whether it is ecological, political, economic, etc, is going to lead
    to disaster.

-   Bateson argues that "the unit of evolutionary survival turns out to
    be identical with the unit of mind."

    > "Ecology, in the widest sense, turns out to be the study of the
    > interaction and survival of ideas and programs (i.e., differences,
    > complexes of differences, etc.) in circuits."

-   If we make the error of taking the wrong unit "you end up with the
    species versus the other species around it or versus the environment
    in which it operates. Man against nature. You end up, in fact, with
    Kaneohe Bay polluted, Lake Erie a slimy green mess, and "Let's
    build bigger atom bombs to kill off the next-door
    neighbors."[@bateson_steps_1987]


## 35. Inheritance: Lamarck and Darwin
-------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How did the elephant get its trunk and the giraffe get its neck?

-   Do we inherit the habits of our ancestors through our genes?

-   Is the 'survival of the fittest' the mechanism whereby nature
    evolves?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Darwin has affected us hugely well outside the realm of biology.
    From evolutionary economics to Marxist theory, anthropology, physics
    and genetics, each has been touched by the Darwinian mindset.

-   Bateson argues that Lamarck's basic idea of the 'inheritance of
    acquired characteristics', whilst being on the surface wrong, was
    the first to consider the question of 'mind' from first principles,
    using 'habit' as one of his axioms. Mind was emergent from habit
    [@bateson_steps_1987] ![image](darwinlamarck.jpg)

-   Bateson further argues that Darwin's mechanism, for all its genius,
    took "mind" out of the equation in the question of survival and
    replaced it with a process of natural selection.

-   Recent biological work suggests that Lamarck may have been at least
    partly right: for example, inheritance of predisposition to asthma
    correlating with the grandparents' smoking. Cellular mechanisms of
    adaptation may be behind surprising patterns of inheritance which go
    beyond natural selection.


## 36. Information
-----------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   What is information?

-   What is the relationship between information and meaning?

-   What is it to be 'in-formed'?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   One of the biggest arguments in science today is about the nature of
    information.

-   This course is made up of information: it is the background of
    education. Formal education systems enlist mechanisms for codifying
    the knowledge and skills of individuals into information.

-   There is information on the computer screen that you might be
    staring at reading this. Information is analysed, and the analysis
    produces more information.

-   Biologists analyse the information in DNA, and physicists look for
    the information in Black Holes.
    ![image](synergetics.jpg)

-   Information has a measurement developed by Claude Shannon, without
    whose equations, the internet would not work. In Shannon's work,
    Information is equivalent to 'uncertainty'.

-   Information is used to make decisions. We are told with better
    information, we make better decisions. More and more effort is put
    into generating more and more information.

-   If we don't understand information, what do we mean by meaning?


## 37. Paradigm Shifts and Analysis
----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How do we know we do research right?

-   What happens when a new discovery turns everything we know
    upside-down (for example, Copernicus or Einstein)?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Scientific history is full of stories where science was turned
    upside down. Thomas Kuhn calls these moments a 'paradigm shift'
    [@kuhn_structure_1996].

-   Such moments are the result of an analytical approach to science,
    where fundamental generating mechanisms for the world being the way
    it is are reconsidered from the bottom up.
    ![image](duck-rabbit.jpg)

-   Most research in almost all fields in universities is not analytic
    like this, and analytic work is often difficult to get published.

-   Most research work is instead synthetic: an approach to research
    which gathers evidence from a variety of empirical situations and
    attempts to fit an explanatory framework over the perceived
    phenomena.

-   Paul Feyerabend argued that the adherence to ways of researching and
    theories of science which were obviously not right had to do with
    irrational human processes of defending egos and reputations of
    scientists and the status of institutions[@feyerabend_against_2010].
    He argued that no theory of science should exclude these factors,
    and that only by acknowledging it would a deeper awareness of the
    social process of science be possible.


## 38. Cosmological Thinking
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   Should we think about the details of particular phenomena, or should
    we think about how the whole universe gives rise to particular
    phenomena?

-   How can a cosmology be verified?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The result of analytical thinking is a deeper cosmology about why
    the universe is the way it is

-   Such cosmologies characterise the work of scientific revolutionaries
    like Newton, Galileo, Einstein. In each case, they radically rethink
    the story of the universe.

-   In order to comprehend what underlying mechanisms are, one has to
    see *beyond* what is immediately perceived.

-   Synthetic approaches to science, rather than analytical approaches,
    dominate most of what goes by the name of 'research' in
    universities: in physics, a unified theory has been the goal for
    many generations of physicists who have attempted to unify quantum
    mechanics with relativity and Newtonian mechanics: so far the
    approach has failed. In biology, synthesis leads to the variety of
    specialised theories of epigenesis and genetics.

-   As with physics, nothing coherent has yet emerged, and indeed there
    is no explanation for the ways in which cells organise to produce
    hearts, brains and fingers. In medicine, synthetic methods gather
    evidence of 'markers' for disease from genetics, neurology,
    endocrinology, and so on, and then seeks to explain disease through
    the presence of markers.

-   It should not therefore surprise us to know that research efforts
    into learning and education (of which biological, physical and
    physiological theories are a subset) lack coherence and explanatory
    power.

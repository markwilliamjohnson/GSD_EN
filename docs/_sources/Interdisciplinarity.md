Interdisciplinarity
===================

## 48. What are you studying?
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Where is the boundary between the subject you are studying and other
    subjects?

-   Are subjects in university real things - do they actually exist in
    the jobs people do in the world?

-   If all the theory you are taught was actually true, how different
    would the world look to the way it actually does?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Each of you is a student studying a subject in the 'School of
    economics and management'. What is 'economics'? What is
    'management'? There are no clear answers to these questions. All
    that can be said is that they are 'topics of discussion'. So is that
    all a 'subject' is?... a topic of discussion?

-   But how much discussion about your subject do you really do in
    university? In University, subjects are divided into 'topics', and
    assessments are set around those topics. All of a sudden, you are
    not able to ask what the big 'subject' is, because you have small
    tasks to complete otherwise you will fail your course! And asking
    too many difficult questions can get very disruptive!

-   And we are all told that we study the subjects we do because it will
    help us get jobs. Does it really? Where in the real world is there a
    'topic' of 'economics'? Of course, people buy and sell things,
    create businesses, and so on. But nobody fully understands this
    basic human behaviour.



## 49. The Discipline of Education
---------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why is education often boring?

-   Is education a subject?

-   What is education for?

-   Do you need to come to university when you can learn so much online?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   There is much confusion about what education is and there is no
    coherent theory of it.

-   Education may be often boring because we have a bad theory of
    education. If we had a better theory, then learning would perhaps be
    more in tune with the way that human consciousness works.

-   Boredom itself is a reaction to a kind of oppression.

-   The topic of education itself is not of the same kind as the topics
    of physics, maths or chemistry. Sociologist Everett Hughes argued
    that education was not a discipline but rather "a major complex of
    arts". He explains that it is not a discipline:

    > "in the sense of offering a single order of phenomena which, when
    > observed and/or manipulated in a systematic way, yield a body of
    > consistent theory. In this respect, education is like the other
    > great practical arts - looking after the sick, keeping order, and
    > distributing justice. All of them, however, give rise to a variety
    > of disciplines and, in turn, use many of their results. These arts
    > are the very springs of human curiosity; they are also great
    > consumers of man's best intellectual and scientific efforts. None
    > of these arts, moreover, is ever completely under the control of
    > the human will, the will of one man or of some small group of men,
    > or even of society at large through its instruments. Yet control
    > over these arts is sought in all societies. The manner of
    > practicing them is the very stuff of the clash of wills and
    > interests; thus, the stuff of
    > politics."[@hughes_sociological_1985]

-   Hughes's distinction between a 'discipline' and a 'complex of arts'
    is helpful in the sense that it causes us to ask whether there is a
    'body of consistent theory' about education

-   In education, what is accepted as 'theory' is often an amalgamation
    of ideas drawn from different sources and used in a rhetorical way
    to defend particular interventions or practices.


## 50. Distinctions
------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is a distinction?

-   How is one distinction related to another?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Drawing a distinction between one thing and another is always the
    first (and essential) step in being able to study something.
    Distinctions are made about biological species, artistic forms,
    philosophical positions, times of day, colours, or sounds and
    movements. Education feeds on distinctions. To study education is to
    study the way distinctions are made and the dynamics of their
    interaction.

-   A distinction is a boundary. It constrains one set of things as
    belonging to one group, and another set of things as belonging to a
    different group. In making a distinction about red butterflies, a
    line is drawn and criteria established to identify whether a
    particular object belongs on the side of the line which says 'red
    butterflies' and everything else not a red butterfly. The red
    butterfly distinction is marked by constraining what does not meet
    the criteria (other distinctions) for a red butterfly. A distinction
    is a *choice* of a constraint. The choosing, however, is itself
    constrained by other things: for example, norms, values,
    institutions, education and individual expectations.

-   Every distinction exists within distinctions at a different level.
    We might make the distinction about butterflies, but where are the
    distinctions made about the scientific or aesthetic norms, values
    and expectations within which the butterfly distinction is made? To
    explore distinction-making as a process, we have to become aware of
    both sides of the distinction in order to see the complex structures
    of hierarchies which might be at work in establishing even the
    simplest judgements about reality.

-   In education we draw a distinction much like the distinction which
    Hughes tries to draw. If we want to say education is $x$, $y$ or
    $z$, then a distinction is drawn with $x$, $y$ or $z$ in a box, and
    everything that isn't $x$ outside the $x$ box Then we can say that
    everything outside $x$ constrains the definition of $x$.
    Distinctions become *drawable*.

-   In a simple way, Hughes distinction between Education as a complex
    of arts and what he calls 'disciplines' can be drawn as in Figure
    [[fig:educationconstraint]](#fig:educationconstraint){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:educationconstraint"}.

    ![Hughes's defininition of education within uncertain
    constraints[]{label="fig:educationconstraint"}](noteducation){#fig:educationconstraint
    width="columnwidth"}

-   Drawing it like this immediately raises questions. The arrows
    between the disciplines in the diagram show a relationship which is
    not clear in Hughes's description. *Maths* and *Physics* have a
    relation to *education*. Education shapes what they are: so
    shouldn't they be *within* the education box? But also Maths and
    physics have a relationship to each other: mathematical techniques
    like calculus derived from new theories in physics and astronomical
    observations. So this diagram isn't very satisfactory - but the lack
    of clarity in Hughes's description becomes apparent through trying
    to draw it as a diagram.


## 51. Transduction: The process of upholding a distinction
----------------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   What is the process that converts an analogue signal to digital?

-   What is the process that maintains a boundary between something?

-   If a boundary between one thing and another changes, what happens to
    other boundaries?

-   How does society change over time?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   If there are many possible distinctions about 'maths', 'education',
    'hospitals' or 'chairs' how it is that we maintain relatively stable
    distinctions in society? There must be a process which is
    responsible for maintaining a coherent and agreed set of
    distinctions around which we coordinate our social lives, our
    education system, our scientific practice, and so on. Cybernetics
    gives a name name to the process of maintaining a distinction: it is
    *transduction*.

-   In engineering, transduction is the process of taking one form of
    energy and turning it into another - like an electric transformer or
    a heat exchanger. In those examples, and in every other example of
    transduction, what results is a boundary - or a distinction.

-   The transduction process works on both sides of a distinction. By
    recognising that distinctions are maintained by a process is to
    recognise that the process may change - and a change to the
    distinction-making process at one level can lead to changes in the
    distinction-making process at many other levels too. To change a
    social system - or indeed any system - we have to 'tweak the
    transducers'!

-   All distinctions are the result of transduction processes.

-   Societies change when their distinctions about themselves change,
    and this changes when the structure of their transductions change.


## 52. Inside and Outside in economics
-------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What are the internal economic considerations that businesses must
    consider?

-   What are the external considerations that businesses must consider?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Strengthening the economic potential of the enterprise is impossible
    without improving the planning process, reflecting the process of
    implementation of innovations. These are internal processes.

-   The role of the target quantitative criterion in this case can be
    performed by an indicator of investment activity (the result of cash
    flow). It is also important to balance the amounts of positive and
    negative cash flows, analyze the relationship between the cash flow
    balance of current operations and net profit (loss).

-   The dynamics of changes in profit should correspond to the change in
    the balanced cash flows from the current activity. To maximize
    profits, it is necessary to minimize material costs and ensure the
    growth of labor productivity by reducing the labor intensity of
    products and works based on innovations.

-   The financial strategy of the company should be developed taking
    into account the risk of non-payments, inflation spikes and other
    force majeure circumstances.

-   Financial control is necessary for the timely identification of
    internal reserves, improving the profitability of the economy,
    increasing cash savings in the enterprise. Many of these require a
    consideration of external factors.

-   The use of an integrated automated management system for the
    formation of financial statements at the enterprise will allow
    processing the information base and regularly receive an operative
    report on its financial status of the company, will become a tool
    for diagnosis and continuous monitoring of the financial situation.

-   The use of modern information technologies will ensure the accuracy
    and coherence of actions of all employees, including those involved
    in the management process, the strengthening of internal financial
    control in the enterprise, the aggregation of information based on
    the processing of indicators of different levels of planning.

-   As a result, adequate and timely risk assessment will be possible,
    minimization of costs and effective operation of the enterprise in
    order to strengthen its economic potential in the face of uncertain
    market conditions.


## 53. Inside and Outside in Tourism
-----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What might 'inside' and 'outside' refer to in tourism?

-   what is the function of a tourism company in maintaining the
    relations between the 'inside' and 'outside' among its customers and
    suppliers?

-   What is leisure or recreation?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Tourism intertwines culture, economics, ecology and management

-   Tourist resources are divided into cultural, natural, socio-cultural
    sites. It should be noted that it was cultural factors /culture that
    acted and acted as a driver of tourism development.

-   In the era of globalization, tourism acts as a link in the
    intercultural development and mutual understanding between peoples.

-   Tourism as a sphere of recreation is in interrelation with the
    environment. Recreational areas are very fragile, vulnerable,
    resources are exhausted.

-   Sometimes spontaneous, uncontrolled development of tourism creates a
    number of environmental problems: the destruction of natural
    landscapes, the modification of components of the natural
    environment, etc.

-   Accordingly, the formation of environmental awareness among tourism
    professionals, the understanding of related scientific branches
    necessary.

-   As a sphere of the economy, tourism is an active source of
    replenishment of the revenue side of budgets of different levels,
    has a multiplying effect on related industries.

-   In the tourist professional activity the leading role is occupied by
    management. Management in the field of tourism has a specific
    nature, because a tourist product is, first of all, a service
    product that requires a system approach to management, which is
    oriented to the development of the human resource of the enterprise
    and is "sharpened" for the interests of the client.


## 54. Meta-Language
-------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   When do you talk about the way you talk?

-   Why might it be useful to have an agreed way of talking about
    talking?

-   How is a language about systems useful?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   What has been described as a process of upholding sets of
    distinctions has a more formal description in cybernetics developed
    by Stafford Beer.

-   Beer understood that the fundamental problems of institutions
    concerned how they made distinctions about themselves: the Viable
    System Model presented a kind of template upon which institutions
    and businesses could project their current operations and speculate
    on new ways of organising themselves.

-   Beer worked in Chile in 1971, to work with Salvadore Allende on the
    establishment of a technologically-driven socialist state.

-   The distinction between an organism and its environment is
    maintained through a process of attenuation of the environment by
    the organism, and the amplification of organism's attenuations
    through the production of multiple descriptions of it. Any organism
    must somehow coordinate which parts of its operations to attenuate
    the environment. This means that as part of the organism there must
    be a higher-level function which examines the function of the
    organism's operations and attempts to coordinate them.


## 55. Organism and Environment
------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the relationship between an organism and its environment?

-   How does an organism adapt to survive in its environment?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

![Coordination between environment (E) of Variety $V_M$, organism (O) of
Variety $V_O$ and organism metasystem (M) of Variety
$V_M$[]{label="ref:basictransduction"}](Varietymgmt1){#ref:basictransduction
width="columnwidth"}

-   Organisms are complex systems, but their environment is more
    complex. Their complexity can be considered as *variety* and
    represented as $V_O$, while the complexity of the environment is
    $V_E$

-   To survive in an environment, the organism has first to attenuate
    the complexity of the environment, and amplify its own complexity.

-   However, if the organism simply reacted to the environment, it would
    not be able to develop. It also needs a meta-system which is able to
    steer the adaptations of the organism by observing how the organism
    adapts.


## 56. Recursion
---------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why do patterns contain patterns which contain patterns?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   ![Recursive
    transductions[]{label="recursive"}](recursivevariety){#recursive
    width="columnwidth"}

-   Each level of transduction produces an attenuation of the level
    below it. Each level of transduction presents multiple descriptions
    of itself to the level above. The central issue here is that the
    attenuations are by necessity always approximations.

-   Each level engages directly with the level below by presenting
    multiple descriptions of the attenuation that it produces. This
    process of producing multiple descriptions of attenuation might be
    thought of as 'amplification'.

-   The result of the combined process of amplification and attenuation
    is that there is *error* between the multiple descriptions of the
    world as it is and the attenuated descriptions of it. The central
    issue is what to do about the error.

-   Errors are manifested in the multiplicity of descriptions that each
    level presents to the level above. These multiple descriptions are
    similarly attenuated and amplified, and similarly produce error at
    the next level. And so it goes on.


## 57. Amplification and Attenuation in Organisational Structure
---------------------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why are hierarchies a bad idea in an uncertain environment?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   All hierarchies work on the principle of attenuation: attenuation
    from the environment to the system, and attenuation from bottom to
    top.

-   The boss cannot absorb information about the detail about what is
    happening in the environment or on the ground: they have to work
    with an abstract representation of reality.

-   In a highly uncertain and complex environment, this means that a
    hierarchy is not able to absorb the complexity of its environment or
    its operation, and so its self-adaptation does not work effectively.
    Instead, the instinct of hierarchies is to defend themselves by
    becoming more authoritarian.

    ![Two dimensions of attenuation in the organisation: From bottom to
    top (vertical), and from the environment to the individual
    (horizontal)](Slide2){width="columnwidth"}

-   There exist approaches to organisation which avoid the problems of
    hierarchy. Whilst attenuation is necessary for any system to manage
    any other system of greater complexity than itself, recursive
    distinction-making can create a dynamically adaptive system whose
    operations in its environment are continually adapted according to
    the difference between the attenuations and the actual behaviour of
    the environment.

-   Whilst recursion is the key to effective adaptive behaviour and each
    level of transduction has the same structure as every other, each
    level of recursion attenuates and amplifies different differences.
    Because of this, recursive transduction structures lead to what can
    be identified as differences in *function* at different levels of
    recursion.

-   This second point is important when considering educational
    institutions. The environment of teachers is different from the
    environment of learners, or the environment of the institution's
    accountants, or its managers. Each functional unit makes different
    attenuations and amplifications based on the information presented
    to it by lower levels, and presents different information to high
    levels of transduction.

![Multiple levels of recursive transduction within a connected
environment](attenuate1){width="columnwidth"}


## 58. Anticipatory Systems
--------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is anticipation?

-   How does a system construct a model of itself?

-   How is anticipation connected to consciousness?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Living systems anticipate changes in their environment. If they did
    not do this, they would be unable to react to threats.

-   Biologists including Robert Rosen [@rosen_anticipatory_2012] and
    mathematicians including Daniel Dubois [@dubois_computing_1998] have
    studied the phenomena which described a complex dynamic system
    whereby what is anticipated depends on a simultaneous processing of:

    1.  what has happened in the past

    2.  a model of what is happening

    3.  speculation on possible models of what might be happening, and
        what might be possible.

-   Dubois has elaborated this process using three simple equations
    equations showing how the dynamic interaction between what he calls
    a 'recursive' equation $(1)$, an 'incursive' equation $(2)$ and a
    'hyperincursive' equation $(3)$ produces an interference pattern
    which displays self-similarity at recursive levels
    [@dubois_computing_1998]. ![image](dubois2.jpg)


-   Consciousness may operate according to these principles making us
    'reflexive systems'. Such a system as a 'conscious' system would
    continually and simultaneously be processing what is happening
    around us (1), thinking about why what is happening is happening
    (2), and considering and evaluating alternative explanations for why
    things are happening, and what might happen next (3).


## 59. Fractals and Symmetry
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the connection between living processes and mathematical
    processes which produce patterns that look like living things?

-   Is nature mathematical?

-   Is nature symmetrical?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   A fractal is a pattern which displays similarity in its structure at
    different levels. Common fractals include the Mandelbrot set and the
    Julia set.

-   Fractals look like living systems, and many living systems like fir
    cones, fern leaves, and sea shells display fractal patterns.

-   Danield Dubois's mathematics of anticipatory systems produce
    self-similar structures which also look like fractals

-   The common factor between these different patterns is a symmetry at
    different levels. Equally, symmetry, or rather broken symmetry
    underpins current theories of the emergence of structure in the
    universe ![image](fractal.jpg)

-   In physics, the structure of matter at the most basic level is
    suggested as being the result of a symmetry-breaking process

-   There appears to be a connection between symmetry-breaking of
    physics and the symmetry breaking of biology has been made by both
    biologists, physicists and mathematicians.

-   Some, including David Bohm and Karl Pribram [@bohm_wholeness_2002]
    have even suggested that symmetry-breaking processes are the common
    link that connected physics to biology to consciousness


## 60. Creativity in Education
-----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What are the advantages of the developed creative thinking?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Creativity:

    -   changes attitudes towards life

    -   allows you to give up passive attitude towards it

    -   enables you to become the force that causes change and shapes
        your future

    -   provides quick thinking and flexibility of thinking;

    -   promotes the breadth of thinking, knowledge, applied methods,
        because at the decision of various problems you do not focus
        only on one moment and a way of the decision;

    -   reduces the time and material costs necessary to solve the
        problem; allows you to know the harmony in yourself and in the
        world around you;

    -   enriches the inner and outer world of man;

    -   teaches to be in the present and simultaneously know and feel
        the past and the future; provides internal growth;

    -   fills life with joy, meaning, purpose; makes life bright,
        creative;

    -   creativity can not be insipid, indifferent, nihilistic;

    -   helps to be more calm and persistent in solving problems;

    -   increases your confidence in the correctness of your ideas;

    -   helps to better understand the thoughts of other people and,
        therefore, it is better to navigate in the world of people;

    -   helps to distract from stereotypes in thinking;

    -   increases the pleasure that you receive from solving problems,
        the so-called "creative satisfaction".


## 61. Systems and Complexity
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   How do different subjects relate to one another?

-   What is complexity?

-   What is simplicity?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   At this point we must be clear about how a 'system' is to be
    defined. Our first impulse is to point at the pendulum and to say,
    the system is that thing there. This method, however, has a
    fundamental disadvantage: every material object contains no less
    than an infinity of variables and therefore of possible systems. The
    real pendulum, for instance, has not only length and position; it
    has also mass, temperature, electric conductivity, crystalline
    structure, chemical impurities, some radioactivity, velocity,
    reflecting power, tensile strength, a surface film of moisture,
    bacterial contamination, an optical absorption, elasticity, shape,
    specific gravity and so on and on. Any suggestion that we should
    study 'all' the facts is unrealistic, and actually the attempt is
    never made. What is necessary is that we should pick out and study
    the facts that are relevant to some main interest that is already
    given ... The system now means, not a thing, but a list of
    variables. [@ashby_introduction_1956]

-   The word 'complex', as it may be applied to systems, has many
    possible meanings, and I must first make my use of it clear. There
    is no obvious or preeminent meaning, for although all would agree
    that the brain is complex and a bicycle simple, one has also to
    remember that to a butcher the brain of a sheep is simple while a
    bicycle, if studied exhaustively (as the only clue to a crime) may
    present a very great quantity of significant detail. Without further
    justification, I shall follow, in this paper, an interpretation of
    'complexity' that I have used and found suitable for about ten
    years. I shall measure the degree of 'complexity' by the quantity of
    information required to describe the vital system. To the
    neurophysiologist the brain, as a feltwork of fibers and a soup of
    enzymes, is certainly complex; and equally the transmission of a
    detailed description of it would require much time. To a butcher the
    brain is simple, for he has to distinguish it from only about thirty
    other 'meats', so not more than log2 30, i.e., about five bits, are
    involved. This method admittedly makes a system's complexity purely
    relative to a given observer; it rejects the attempt to measure an
    absolute, or intrinsic, complexity; but this acceptance of
    complexity as something in the eye of the beholder is, in my
    opinion, the only workable way of measuring complexity. (Ashby,
    1973 - "Some peculiarities of Complex Systems", Cybernetic
    Medicine, Vol 9, no. 1)


## 62. Control
-------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is control a good thing or a bad thing?

-   How do we know the difference between something being under control
    and something being out of control?

-   How might something out-of-control be brought under control?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Cybernetics was originally defined as '*the art and science of
    control in man and machine*'[@wiener_cybernetics:_2013]. We have
    however, spoken of conversation being a dance, and that the dance
    can either flow, or it can break down - sometimes necessitating the
    teacher to recalibrate their approach. This issue of *dancing* and
    conversation is precisely the same as the issue of *control*.
    Unfortunately however, the word 'control' has some unpleasant
    associations with coercion, a loss of free will, authoritarianism,
    and so on. Yet all of those cases are characterised by a *lack* of
    control. So we require a more precise definition of control.

-   Stafford Beer explains the cybernetic sense of control like this:
    "Control is an attribute of a system. This word is not used in the
    way in which either an office manager or a gambler might use it; it
    is used as a name for *connectiveness*."[@beer_cybernetics_1965]

-   Control can be thought of in the context of two people dancing.
    Control simply refers to the manifest *connection* between dancers
    whose moves complement each other, and who participate in a whole
    system which exhibits coherence in its behaviour. Control is evident
    in two people having a conversation in which they are both deeply
    committed and involved. It is also evident in a game of football
    between two teams, or between two people playing a game of chess.

-   Cybernetics was originally developed in the 1940s as an approach to
    studying the dynamics of mechanical control systems. Norbert
    Wiener's mechanical control problem was how to shoot incoming
    aircraft. The mechanical problem involved feedback: the incoming
    object's position and trajectory would change, and as it did, so the
    calibration of the counter-measures had to be adjusted. The incoming
    aircraft and the missile targetting system engaged in a dance.


## 63. Science and Life
----------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How can science understand life?

-   How can art help us understand life?

-   What is science not good at describing?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   All processes occur over time. Whilst the world continually moves
    forward, clocks continue to tick, the second law of thermodynamics
    gradually sees the increase in disorder in the universe, life
    creates new order.

-   Biological processes work against the second law of thermodynamics,
    creating order in plants and animals, where metabolism produces
    order through consuming food, and thought produces increase order in
    our brains. Schroedinger argued that this was a fundamental
    principle of life processes: they work against increasing disorder
    (or *entropy*). Life is about *neg-*entropy:

    > The essential thing in metabolism is that the organism succeeds in
    > freeing itself from all the entropy it cannot help producing while
    > alive. [@schrodinger_what_2012]

-   The unfolding experience of time-based arts like music provides a
    good example of the dynamic tension between entropy and negentropy,
    and has many similarities to the experience of learning. Cinema,
    music and theatre are forms of expression which display two
    interacting dimensions which are also common to all learning
    processes. There is a dimension of structure of things which occur
    at any moment, and there is a dimension of things which unfold over
    time.

-   Science and art look at the world in different ways. Both
    information (neg-entropy) and time are fundamental problems in
    science, which necessitate the descriptions of artists in order to

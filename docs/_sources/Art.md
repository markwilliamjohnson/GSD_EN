Art and Creativity 
===================

## 15. Artists and Scientists
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is it possible to articulate a scientifically-grounded description
    of the activity of a creative artist?

-   What do artists and scientists have in common?

-   How are they different?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Artistic thinking seems fundamentally different from scientific
    thinking; the type of people who work in the sciences and in the
    arts seem fundamentally different. Yet great original scientists
    such as Tesla, and great artists such as Leonardo appear to have
    much in common.

-   Scientists create abstractions which describe the world with
    equations and models. Artists create abstractions which describe the
    world in paint, light, sound, movement.

-   Both produce multiple descriptions of the world, and generating new
    possibilities for looking at the world. Artists are important
    because they show us how to look at the world differently.

## 16. Are you an artist?
------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How many times do you take photographs on your phone?

-   How many times do you post photographs on Social Media (VK,
    Facebook, etc)

-   What are you doing when you do this?

-   How many descriptions of your life are on social media?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   If artistic thinking is about creating multiple descriptions of
    reality, then we are more artistic than we might think!

-   Every time we take a photograph we create a description. In posting
    on social media, we add that description to our other descriptions
    which are there. We also add it to the descriptions of others.

-   However, there is a difference between what we do and what an artist
    might do: artists assemble multiple descriptions of things so that
    they become coherent.

-   Artists find the common pattern between different descriptions.
    Artistic skill involves manipulating multiple descriptions to reveal
    their common pattern.

-   Finding a common pattern is a way of speaking about a deeper sense
    of reality.

## 17. Multiple Descriptions in Video
------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   If you want to learn to fix a leaking tap or a fault in your car, do
    you look for some text on Wikipedia or do you look for a YouTube
    video?

-   When you watch a youtube video, what happens to you over time?

-   At a key moment of surprise in a video, what are the elements which
    cause the surprise?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Video presents multiple descriptions of the world over time.

-   The multiple descriptions presented by video have many dimensions
    and change over time.

-   Edgar Morin, in his book "Cinema and the imaginary man"
    [@morin_cinema_2005], details the different descriptions that the
    cinema presents. These include:

    -   the way that light and shadow changes

    -   the way that the size of objects change

    -   the way that the sound and music of a movie changes

        ![image](vertov.jpg)

        newpage
    -   the way that speech changes

    -   the way that the camera moves

    -   the cutting of one shot to the next

    -   ... and so on ...

-   Morin's different dimensions are related. In asking how YouTube
    communicates multiple descriptions over time, we can ask about the
    structural relationship between its different elements.

-   Many of these issues of the moving image were considered in Russian
    cinema - particularly in the work of Vertov and Eisenstein.

## 18. Multiple Descriptions in Poetry
-------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How is poetry like video?

-   How is poetry like science?

-   How does a poet describe something which has no name - like a
    feeling?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Text appears to be a much less rich medium than video. However, in
    poetry, text can be used to convey deep things which lie beyond any
    individual word.

-   The way text is able to do this is by layering different
    descriptions of something on top of one another.

-   In poetry, descriptions are not just in the words themselves, but in
    their rhythm and in the way that they rhyme.

-   With the kind of overlaying of descriptions Ezra Pound describes how
    it is that words are assembled from other words. To define 'red',
    for example, Pound asks

    > "How can the poet to do it in a picture that isn't painted in red
    > paint? He puts (or his ancestor put) together the abbreviated
    > pictures of
    >
    >   ----------- ----------
    >   ROSE        CHERRY
    >   IRON RUST   FLAMINGO
    >   ----------- ----------
    >
-   Pound argues that this

    > is very much the kind of thing a biologist does (in a very much
    > more complicated way) when he gets together a few hundred or
    > thousand slides, and picks out what is necessary for his general
    > statement. Something that fits the case, that applies in all of
    > the cases."

## 19. Computer-generated Objects
--------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Could a computer be an artist?

-   Much modern art now uses computers - what do the computers
    contribute to artistic expression?

-   What is the difference between a computer-generated object and a
    natural object?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The computer generates lights on a screen to create virtual
    'objects'. These virtual objects can be easily manipulated, and
    algorithms can generate infinite variations of an object

-   Human beings point at computer-generated objects and in the process
    reveal something about themselves in relation to them. Since there
    are many different computer-generated objects, there are many
    possible ways in which individuals might reveal something about
    themselves.

-   With 3D printing, computers are able to create an increasing array
    of physical objects, including paper documents, 3D printed models
    and even buildings.

    ![image](google-machine-learning-art.jpg)

-   Practical uses of computer-generated objects include the use of
    adaptive algorithms to maximise the performance of a vehicle (for
    example, 'genetic algorithms'), or the use of shared 3D
    architectural plans in the design of a building (a technology known
    as 'Building Information Modelling')

-   Virtual reality is another example of computer-generated objects
    which provide multiple descriptions of the world.

-   Visualisations (or 'visual analytics') of data can also provide many
    different descriptions of reality, highlighting particular features
    of the data about which people can talk.

## 20. Emoji communication
-------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why do people send smileys, or WeChat stickers to each other in
    communications?

-   What is the difference between using a word for something and a
    sticker?

-   If you were to respond to this question with a sticker, what would
    it be?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Since the advent of texting, communications have been increasingly
    augmented with pictures and symbols.

-   Each sticker has particular structural properties which are
    presented in a single moment. Many stickers are animations, and
    present information over time. The structure of single moment is
    what is called *synchronic* and the unfolding over time is called
    *diachronic* ![image](wechat.jpg)

-   Conversations work in a similar way: they comprise diachronic and
    synchronic aspects, each contributing multiple descriptions which
    are coordinated throughout the process.

-   Combining stickers and words creates complex mixtures of different
    elements all of which are saying similar things in different ways.

-   When you send stickers to each other, are you being an artist?


## 21. Creativity and Happiness
------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Does being creative make you happy? If so, why?

-   Is mental illness related to creativity?

-   When you express a feeling that is inside, what changes occur in
    your environment?

-   When you express a feeling that is inside, what changes occur in
    you?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The creative process is one of the highest attainments of the human
    intellect. Within hierarchies of learning such as Bloom's taxonomy
    [@bloom_taxonomy_1956], we find 'creativity' at the top of a range
    of intellectual achievement from memory recall at the bottom to
    synthesis and analysis in the middle.

-   In psychoanalytical approaches to the creative process, it has been
    suggested that creativity is a state of being which connects the Ego
    (the self) with the Id (the unconscious) in a continual process
    [@read_education_1958; @ehrenzweig_hidden_1968; @milner_not_2010].

-   Mental illness is characterised as "creativity gone
    wrong"[@ehrenzweig_hidden_1968].

-   This can be compared to Freud's therapeutic process which is
    conversationally-oriented (a 'talking cure'), drawing out utterances
    from the patient where the 'primary process' material of dreams is
    summoned into the world of the Ego and language.

-   The cure for psychological trauma through this conversational
    process lies in the articulating of psychodynamic blockages and
    bringing them into the therapist-patient conversation.

![image](ehrenzweig.jpg) *Labyrinth (sequential
structure) of creative search. The creative thinker must move forward on
a broad front, revealing many options. He should get a comprehensive
look at the whole structure of the way forward, without being able to
focus on any one opportunity.*

## 22. Mental Process, Individuation and Successful people
---------------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is it to know who you are?

-   How have successful people, across all fields, developed such a
    strong sense of self-identity which gives them confidence to act in
    the world?

-   What is the balance between mind and action among successful people?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   'Individuation' is Jung's term for the process whereby the self
    emerges from undifferentiated unconciousness.

-   The essential concept of a dynamic relation between the components
    of consciousness is similar to Freud's relation between Ego, Id and
    Superego.

-   What happens between the therapist and the patient in psychoanalysis
    is a process of drawing-out things from the subconscious into
    consciousness, through turning subconscious phenomena into
    communications with the therapist. Психический процесс,
    индивидуализация и успешные люди

-   Rebalancing is essential to individuation: it is what happens when
    the uncertainty of the psyche is balanced with the management of
    uncertainty of social relations to the point where the individual
    can see themselves as 'whole' and distinct from other individuals
    and other things.

-   In Jungian psychoanalysis, individuation is assisted through
    recognition of fundamental *archetypes* in what Jung calls the
    *collective unconscious*.


## 23. Uncertainty
-----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   When you are uncertain about something, what do you do?

-   To what extent is uncertainty in the individual mind, and to what
    extent is it in the social environment?

-   Why in conversation important for the management of uncertainty?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Uncertainty is present in the individual mind - nobody is entirely
    sure of everything

-   Uncertainty is also present in the social environment: because
    nobody is sure of anything, there is much argument about the meaning
    of things, political issues, scientific knowledge, and so on.

-   Systems modelling techniques can help in exploring the relationship
    between the management of uncertainty in the psyche and the
    management of uncertainty in the environment.

-   Drawing the uncertainty management process in this way helps to
    connect both the psychodynamic mechanism of Freud with the
    relational mechanism of Bowlby in a coherent way. It further
    suggests that the damage to attachment relations will inevitably
    have psychodynamic effects.

-   The struggle to manage uncertainty with regard to proximity to a
    caregiver must be related to some deeper uncertainty concerning the
    undifferentiated experience of a baby (and indeed, the mother), and
    the more concrete 'categories' of experience which arise whereby
    'proximity' becomes a thing over which the child attempts to
    exercise control. In this way, the undifferentiated subconscious of
    the baby and the mother, and the mechanism by which the uncertainty
    of the subconscious is managed form a coherent part of the
    attachment process.


## 24. Generosity
----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How might generosity help to manage uncertainty?

-   Are artists generous in the way they express themselves?

-   Is being open in the way that emotions are expressed similar to
    being generous?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Imagine giving a present to someone: a gift is a highly complex
    object open to many interpretations. It's meaning is often
    ambiguous. It is this ambiguity which makes it powerful.

-   When exchanging something for money, the meaning and value of the
    exchange must be clear to all who participate in it. A gift,
    however, is an object which functions by revealing something of the
    inner worlds of the giver and the receiver.

    ![image](potlatch.jpg)

-   A gift is an invitation to reveal individual uncertainty to one
    another, bringing it into the social domain where conversation can
    produce new dynamics which maintain social cohesion.

-   Anthropologist George Bataille [@bataille_accursed_1991], thought
    deeply about gifts. Influenced by Mauss's concept of potlatch
    [@mauss_gift:_2011], Bataille argued that gifts within communities
    were processes of acknowledging the fundamental uncertainties of
    existence.

-   In giving, Bataille argues that squander or waste was then the
    principal act, and in primitive society it took the form of human
    sacrifice and lavish feasts.

-   In modern society it can take the form of exuberant behaviour - from
    art to football matches.

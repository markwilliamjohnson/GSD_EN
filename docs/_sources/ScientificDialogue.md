Scientific Dialogue
===================

## 64. Educational Assessment
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Do essays measure a student's understanding or does it measure their
    ability to write essays?

-   How can understanding be measured?

-   Does everybody's understanding take the same form?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The assessment of learning by institutions is one of their primary
    functions. It involves many levels of bureaucracy and
    decision-making

-   Gaining institutional certificate are one of the reasons why people
    go university in the first place. The certificate is a 'product' of
    the university

-   Universities have to maintain trust in their judgements in order to
    maintain their position in society. If they passed everybody, for
    example, nobody would trust the certificates they award. In this
    sense, "education has to create failure," as Ivan Illich observed
    [@illich_deschooling_1995]

-   The assessment process, objects are produced by students
    (assignments, essays and exams) about which judgements (marks) can
    be made. In order to get good marks, it is important that students
    comply with the expectations of their teachers.

-   It is theoretically possible to comply with teacher expectations
    without understanding very much.


## 65. Communicating Uncertainty
-------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   If modern science is driven by calculations of probability, how sure
    can we be that anything is right?

-   What is the difference between the status of scientific knowledge in
    the enlightenment and science today?

-   How should we communicate our uncertainties?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   In 1763 the journal system of blind peer review was designed as a
    democratic mechanisms to establish truth through discursive
    engagement with reports of the empirical regularities of Newtonian
    science.

-   The journal article was well-suited to amplifying the detailed
    description of apparatus, method and results from which speculation
    about causes could follow.

-   Communication of the probabilistic and contingent nature of modern
    science is poorly achieved through the academic journal article.
    When the probabilistic modelling of economics or patterns in DNA,
    the analysis of big data, or the investigation of quantum fields or
    the study of ecologies is represented in the journal literature, the
    reported statistically significant results (reported through
    p-values and statistical hypothesis) often mask the more significant
    uncertainties surrounding the work.

-   There have been attempts to address this. New models of peer-review
    have been introduced alongside new models of open access publishing
    [@anderson_open_2004].

-   More interesting is the demand to make publishing much more
    flexible, embracing things like blogs, and (particularly) the
    publishing of data.

-   Equally, the engagement of a wider community with scientific
    research in initiatives like 'Citizen Science' are more powerful
    ways of coordinating the uncertainties of a much wider section group
    of people, not all of whom will be professional scientists.

-   Such democratisation in the communication of uncertainty is closer
    in spirit to the original ideals that led to the establishment of
    the academic journal in the first place.


## 66. Democracy and Science
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is science possible in an unfree society?

-   What is the relation between science and freedom?

-   What is the most effective relation between government and science?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The academic journal system was a method of democratising science:
    it was important in the establishing of knowledge that experiments
    could be done by many people, and results discussed openly.

-   Before the Royal Society published its transactions in 1667
    (considered to be the first academic journal), publication was not
    considered something that scientists ought to do.

-   Publishing facilitated the formation of large-scale scientific
    communities within which reproducible empirical results could be
    reported and discussed. Publication practice gradually took on the
    form that we now know it.

-   The Royal Society's practices of peer review was a change not only
    in scientific practice and epistemology, but also in the
    democratisation of intellectual status acquisition. Publication and
    admittance to the academy was technically available to all.

-   One of the principles behind this democratising process was that all
    evidence of scientific phenomena should be considered, whether it
    conformed with existing theories or not. This openness to challenge
    was an essential ingredient in the advancement of science.

-   Today, science is often presented in school as being in a late stage
    of advancement where some things are now beyond doubt. Alongside
    this, governments promote science as an essential ingredient to
    economic development.

-   Yet, history tells us that scientific advance usually occurs by
    overturning things which were once thought to be obviously true, and
    that this is sometimes seen as a political challenge to those
    institutions which have built their reputation on the old way of
    doing things (e.g. Galileo)

-   Government promotion of openness in science, and acceptance of the
    possibility that a different way of looking at things is possible,
    also requires government to be open to the potential political
    challenge that science presents.

-   Many current debates, about climate change, genetic engineering,
    artificial intelligence, etc, all have a political side, and all
    tend to adopt accepted positions which may be open to challenge.


## 67. Publishing
----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why, when there are so many technologies for communicating, do
    scientists continue to publish in academic journals (in the same way
    since 1663?)

-   How can uncertainties been communicated in print?

-   Are we saying more and more about less and less?

-   Whose uncertainty about science isn't relevant to inquiry?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   For academics, publication in high ranking research journals brings
    the prospect of promotion and potential job security in what is
    increasingly an insecure profession (maybe to 'tenured professor' or
    its equivalent - another status declaration within the institution),
    or it brings increased funding within the institution. Institutions
    with many academics producing high-ranking research papers perform
    more highly in international rankings of institutions, which in turn
    increase their chances of winning research funding and recruiting
    high calibre students.

-   Each declaration of status is also a declaration of scarcity, and
    the principal mode of operation of the institution is the declaring
    of knowledge and accreditation for knowing to be scarce. This sits
    at odds with the growth of technologies which provide access to
    knowledge everywhere. Journal publication is a license to make a
    small change to the world. Alongside the license comes other
    prestige indicators which carry value for individuals: in today's
    academia, publications help to secure the position of academics in
    universities (without them, they can lose their jobs). Beyond
    publication itself, citations serve as 'evidence' of approval of a
    community. Fame and status as a "thought leader"
    [@sismondo_key_2013] comes from many citations, which in turn brings
    invitations to keynotes at conferences, editorial roles, expert
    advisory positions, through to secondary studies of an author's
    work. Fundamentally, there is a demarcation between 'academic
    celebrity' and everyone else: academic publication counts because it
    is (or is perceived to be) scarce. This state of affairs raises
    ontological questions about how the social world of science and
    education works.


## 68. Dialogue and Science
--------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   When we really listen to each other, and tune-in to another person's
    thought, do we glimpse something of the structure of the universe?

-   Do scientists listen to one another or do they compete for
    attention?

-   What would our scientific institutions look like if we took
    listening to one another as the most important thing to do in
    science?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Bohm argues that "Dialogue is really aimed at going into the whole
    thought process and changing the way the thought process occurs
    collectively. We haven't really paid much attention to thought as a
    process. We have engaged in thoughts, but we have only paid
    attention to the content, not to the process. Why does thought
    require attention? Everything requires attention, really. If we ran
    machines without paying attention to them, they would break down. Or
    thought, too, is a process, and it requires attention otherwise it's
    going to go wrong. "[@bohm_dialogue_2013]

-   Among the symptoms of thought going wrong, Bohm cites
    *fragmentation*, or what others have criticised as *reductionism*:
    the breaking down of knowledge into boxes. Bohm goes on to say:
    "Almost everything around us has been determined by thought -- all
    the buildings, factories, farms, roads, schools nations, science,
    technology, religion -- whatever you care to mention. The whole
    ecological problem is due to thought, because we have thought that
    the world is there for us to exploit, that it is infinite, and so no
    matter what we did, the pollution would all get dissolved away."

-   He points out that "we may clear up the pollution, but may then
    create some other difficulty, such as economic chaos if we don't do
    it right."

-   Finally, he argues: "The point is thought produces results, but
    thought says it didn't do it. And that is a problem."

-   What is the problem with thought denying that it makes things happen
    in the world?


## 69. Conversation
------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why do we need to talk to each other when we are feeling very
    confused and uncertain?

-   How does conversation help manage uncertainty?

-   What is the role of love and friendship in managing uncertainty?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   A conversation is a kind of dance. The word *conversation* comes
    from the Latin, *con-versare*. It means, "to turn together". Two
    people can dance and intuitively understand the moves of the other.

-   Learning conversations are coordinations between a teacher and
    learner. There are always processes of recalibration as the teacher
    recognises the need to simply their own complexity so as to maintain
    an effective dialogue with the learner.

-   Conversations are very powerful: they can change peoples' lives in a
    very short time. The way this happens is poorly understood, and as a
    result, the importance of conversation often gets overlooked in the
    way we organise institutions.

-   One of the drivers for conversation is the fact that everybody sees
    the world differently and everybody feels the need to address their
    uncertainties by understanding better the uncertainties of others.

-   People who have deep conversations together are often friends. This
    is not to say that important conversations only happen between
    friends, but that friendship is the name we give to a particular
    kind of conversational relationship.

-   The root of friendship is the ability to freely express uncertainty.
    Through friendship, things that would be hard to say to others, can
    be said, and deep uncertainties - often about very personal
    matters - can be explored.


## 70. Physiology and Knowledge
------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How do our bodies change the way we interact with others?

-   Is a thought in the brain or in the body or in a community?

-   Why does physical activity and physical contact have such a powerful
    effect on the way we feel?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Most people assume that "knowing", "learning", "remembering", etc
    happens in brains. By implication, they mean that consciousness is a
    property of the brain. There is considerable evidence to support
    this: damaged brains usually produce impairment in cognitive
    function. However, although sometimes radical changes in behaviour
    are observed in those with damaged brains, the humanness of the
    individual remains, and sometime with even severe damage to the
    brain, people seem to retain cognitive function.

-   The more profound changes occur in individuals around a person with
    brain damage: their behaviours change too, as accommodation is made
    for cognitive impairment, extraordinary efforts are made to support
    an individual in the expression of their identity in new ways which
    fit their new condition. Being human, it seems, involves rather more
    than an individual brain. It is not even in the "whole" person. It
    is in the whole community.

-   Processes of empathy and emotional connection are not separate from
    individual high level cognitive function. The separation between
    cognition and emotion has partly been driven by assumptions in
    neuroscience that the brain is a computer. Neurons, axons and
    synapses seem like wires and connections, and the logical firing of
    one neuron seems to trigger knock-on firings of connected neurons,
    much in the same way that an electric signal triggers knock-on
    effects in a circuit.

-   Some physicists [@bohm_wholeness_2002] and neuroscientists
    [@damasio_descartes_2006], however, taken a different view. David
    Bohm was highly aware of the importance of emotion in communication.
    In fact, he believed that direct emotional engagements provided a
    deeper scientific insight into the nature of the world than
    rationalistic talk. His theory of Quantum Mechanics but made a
    connection between the structure and process of matter, and
    consciousness.

-   More recent work on the way music communicates, and particularly on
    the sound relations between mothers and babies, is presenting new
    ways of thinking about emotional expressiveness, physiology and
    meaning [@trevarthen_musicality_1999]


## 71. Consciousness and Biology
-------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   If brains are the result of physical processes, which ultimately
    give rise to consciousness, what happens when consciousness
    conceives of the physical processes which underpin it?

**WHY THIS MATTERS**

-   The connection between matter and consciousness must work through
    physiology. Some like Terrence Deacon have made the connection by
    examining how information works from the material world
    [@deacon_incomplete_2012], psychology and through evolution.

-   By focusing on those aspects of biology about which our knowledge is
    rather vague - like epigenesis - Deacon has developed a theory of
    mind based on the study of semiotic communication. However, if there
    is a weakness to this, as with all theories of mind, it lies in the
    theory's ability to account for the way in which it thinks about
    itself.

-   John Torday goes much deeper than this in a theory which draws on
    Bohm's basic idea of what he called the "holographic universe"
    [@bohm_wholeness_2002].

-   Consciousness, Torday argues, arises from the evolution of the cell
    as the basic unit of physiology, and that cellular evolutionary
    process has been driven by the cell's adaptation to ambiguity in its
    environment. Moreover, the cellular adaptive processes reflects
    fundamental structural adaptations in pre-history.

-   Torday suggests that there is a pattern written throughout our flesh
    which connects us to one another and to a single point of origin.

-   This might mean, for example, that when we have deep conversations,
    or experience music together, that the sense of togetherness we
    experience may be a recognition of the common pattern that we share
    in our physiology.

-   In other words, deep thinking about our origins has the same form as
    our origins themselves.


## 72. Uncertainty and Dialogue
------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why does uncertainty give rise to conversation?

-   Is cellular communication similarly a response to the uncertainty in
    a cell's environment?

-   Why might mental illness result from a lack of conversation or
    understanding?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The environment of all organisms is uncertain or ambiguous. It is
    probably no different for humans than it is for amoebas or cells.

-   When you are unsure or uncertain about something, you talk to
    people. Conversation is one of the principle means of managing
    uncertainty.

-   In the biological theory of Torday
    [@john_s._torday_evolutionary_2012], cellular communication is
    considered to be a response to the ambiguity of the cellular
    environment.

-   Ambiguities and uncertainties are the result of other processes of
    adaptation to uncertainty. There are patterns to the ways in which
    different adaptive processes operate at different levels. In
    physics, these patterns are considered to be 'symmetries' or 'broken
    symmetries'.

-   Broken symmetry is the process whereby quantum mechanics believes
    the structure of matter - atoms, molecules, etc - emerges. Whatever
    originating broken symmetry there was is written in new molecular
    adaptations later on, which in turn are performed in environmental
    contexts which twist the path of evolution in one way or another.
    Torday's biology emphasises the importance of stress from the
    environment, which causes cellular mechanisms to stretch and acquire
    new functions (swim bladders change into lungs, for example). And
    consciousness could be part of the same process.

-   Understanding something deeply means becoming aware of a fundamental
    pattern of broken symmetry which connects us to a common point of
    origin. At its root, "understanding" and what we consider to be
    "spirituality" are the same thing.

-   Because of this, dialogue and conversation become essential tools
    for negotiating understanding and dealing with uncertainty. To
    isolate people from understanding and dialogue is to produce the
    conditions for mental illness.

-   As R.D.Laing noted, mental illness is not the sickness of the
    individual. It is the sickness of their environment
    [@laing_divided_2010]. Being "mentally ill" is the only truly
    authentic reaction to that environment, only exacerbated by the
    naive attempts of others to "cure" the individual.


## 73. Ecology of Mind
---------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is ecology the same as mind?

-   Is our ecological crisis the result of faulty reasoning: an error of
    mind?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Gregory Bateson argued that the evolution was not about the
    development of individual organisms in a process of 'survival of the
    fittest', but about the development of 'organism plus environment'.

-   He argued that if we see evolution as simply organisms competing
    against one another, this results in a destroyed environment,
    which - although it is what often happens in human system - is not
    what happens in natural systems.

-   In considering the unit of evolution as 'organism plus environment',
    he argued that this meant that the organism's *idea* of the
    environment had to be taken into consideration. In effect, this
    meant that in order to understand evolution, we have to understand
    'mind'.

-   Bateson talked of an 'ecology of mind' as the realisation of the
    'pattern which connects'. This is rather difficult to understand -
    and certainly open to interpretation of a kind of loose ecological
    thinking that sees 'interconnectedness' without necessarily
    inquiring into exactly what is connected, or even what a
    'connection' or 'pattern' means.

-   Our ecological crisis does provide an indication that Bateson was
    right. Since our systems of economics, politics, education, media
    and so on all see the world as 'competing organisms', we seem
    incapable of preventing the destruction of our environment.

-   What would our systems of economics, politics, education and media
    look like if we considered their development from Bateson's
    perspective of 'organism plus environment'?

## 74. Psychotherapy
-------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why is talking so powerful in psychotherapy?

-   What is so special about talking about profound things?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   All approaches to psychotherapy, whether those of Freud, Jung, Adler
    or the family therapy of Laing, involve conversation.

-   Whilst we tend to think of conversation as merely the exchange of
    words, in psychotherpeutic contexts, words have very powerful
    effects (as they can also have in education).

-   In many branches of psychotherapy, for example, patients are
    encouraged to talk about their dreams. Freud's theory for this was
    that dreams were an aspect of the subconscious, and that in order to
    help the patient, a re-wiring had to be made between the
    subconscious world in the patient and the conscious real world
    outside.

-   The difficulty that many have with Freud's theories is that it is
    very hard to scientifically identify the subconscious, or the
    distinction between it and the conscious mind. In the end, all we
    have to go on is the communication between people.

-   In the social systems theory of Niklas Luhmann
    [@luhmann_social_1996], Luhmann speculated that in talking, we make
    a series of 'selections': we select a meaning - the thing we want to
    say, and we select an utterance - the way we choose to say it.

-   Luhmann further speculated that our selections are dependent on the
    selections of others, and that in making these selections we
    contribute to our social environment.

-   If the cause of mental illness is in the mismatch between the
    subconscious world and the social environment, then the
    transformation of the social world by drawing things up from the
    subconscious can make an important difference to mental state.



## 75. Brains, Hearts and Stomach 
---------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is your mind in your head?

-   Is your mind in your whole body?

-   Is your mind in the whole social environment?

-   Is your mind in the universe?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   We communicate with each other as whole persons, not just brains or
    mouths.

-   Our bodies are capable of a range of emotions and attitudes
    including love, anger, empathy, fear and pride together with
    intellectual abilities including problem solving, creating and
    remembering.

-   We recognise the difference between these activities partly by the
    way they make us feel.

-   The way different emotions and behaviours make us feel changes the
    way we use our bodies to express ourselves.

-   In Neuro-linguistic programming, for example, studies have been done
    on the ways that individuals move their eyes if they are remembering
    things, or creating things.

-   It many academic disciplines, there are different approaches to a
    topic. Each approach has its own traditions, journals and
    communities. Three major approaches are:

    -   Functionalism - an approach which attempts to identify problems
        and seek solutions. Often functional approaches seek to use
        technology to solve complex human problems, and often these
        approaches fail. 'Giant Mirrors in Space' is a functionalist
        approach to global warming, for example.

    -   Critical theory - this is an approach which criticises
        functionalist approaches. It is politically driven, deriving
        from Marxism, and often considers the down-sided of
        functionalism, particularly who loses, whose rights are
        violated, and so on.

    -   Phenomenology and Existentialism - this is an approach which
        focuses on human experience and consciousness. It opposes
        functionalism because it sees functionalist approaches as cold
        and blind to real people. It is sometimes critical of critical
        theory because Marxist approaches tend to be focused on the
        collective rather than the individual.

-   To be critical, or to be functionalist or to be focused on
    individual human experience are attitudes which seem to feel
    different in the body.

-   In discussion, it is sometimes possible to tell from what position
    an individual is coming by looking at how they use their body. For
    example, functionalists are always inventing and creating things in
    their head. Phenomenologists are often thinking about emotions,
    feelings and experience, which is more concerned with the heart. To
    be critical, by contrast, is something that is often felt in the
    gut!

-   Dialogue is about creating a harmony between all these different
    aspects.

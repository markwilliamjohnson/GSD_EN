Technology
==========

## 1. Why Technology? 
----------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   How much time do you spend online?

-   How much time do you spend responding or browsing social media?

-   Could you live without your phone? or the internet?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Technology has fundamentally changed the environment. You are the
    first generation who cannot remember a world without the internet.


    ![image](techgreek.jpg)

-   Technology is transforming the world of employment. Many traditional
    jobs have been automated, and many of the traditional careers like
    law, teaching, business and management have been fundamentally and
    unrecognisably transformed by technology. Whatever career you choose
    for yourself - whether teaching, medicine, stock trading, even being
    an artist - it is highly likely that much of it will involve staring
    at screens and working with software.

-   Technology is always changing. It will always continue to change.

## 2. The Computer
------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   What does the computer do to humans?

-   What has the computer done to society?

-   How can we live in harmony with computers in the future?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Technology and computers allow new forms of control over humans.

-   Computers have created a new kind of human-machine system in
    society, where constraints can be very easily manipulated. We don't
    fully understand how our new human-machine system is different from
    the social system of our parents.

-   Computers facilitate the manipulation of constraints. The way a
    computer screen presents changing possibilities for action as we
    type a phrase into a search engine, click on the hyperlinks which
    are presented to us, and then negotiate whatever new possibilities
    for action have been programmed into particular webpages,
    illustrates the way that constraints can be changed.
    ![image](alzheimers.jpg)

-   The human experience of this process reminds us of the human-machine
    system we are in: very real emotions arise in response to mechanical
    processes, not dissimilar to the fundamental emotional impact of
    physical constraints such as prison walls, one-way traffic systems,
    central heating or alarm clocks.

-   The word 'com-puter' comes from latin "*com-putare*". 'Putare' means
    to *comtemplate* - so the computer is means of contemplating-with.
    With what kind of science might we investigate this, and with what
    kind of tools might we now organise ourselves?

## 3. The Internet as a 'Lifeworld'
-----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   How has the computer affected what we think of as 'real'?

-   How has the computer affected what we think of as 'true' or 'false'?

-   How has the computer affected the way we feel?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The concept of 'Lifeworld' is a way of talking about your everyday
    environment: everything that you think of as being the 'real world'.

-   Each of us has different views of reality, and while some things
    like rocks and trees appear to be universal, we only think this
    because we observe others behaving in predictable ways with rocks
    and trees.

-   Something happens *between* us in the 'real world'. The word
    'intersubjective' describes what happens between us. Husserl and
    Schutz both referred to the concept of the 'lifeworld' as the
    *context* within which intersubjective engagement occurs.
    ![image](lifeworld.jpg)

-   The computer has transformed the Lifeworld of everyone. Have our
    lifeworlds become unstable? The one shared environment within which
    our expectations could be coordinated has changed into multiple
    lifeworlds within which individuals move in and out.

-   Even in face-to-face settings like lectures, students will often
    inhabit different lifeworlds as they explore social media or other
    online distractions.

## 4. Social Media
------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the difference between talking on a social media forum and
    talking to someone face-to-face?

-   Who do you talk to when you post on a social media forum?

-   How do you know that you have really communicated with someone on
    social media?

-   How do you know you have really communicated with someone
    face-to-face?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Imagine a private conversation between you and a friend: the words
    one of you says are only heard by the other person, and their words
    are only heard by you. Of course, they might tell others what you
    said, but that would be *another* private conversation.

-   Social media expands the audience of any potential communication, so
    you're no longer talking to *one* person, but to potentially
    millions.

-   When you talk face-to-face, in order to communicate, you must convey
    the *meaning* of what you want to say. Sometimes you have to choose
    your words carefully. You can judge whether the other person
    understands by how they react to what you say. If they don't react
    as you expected, do you try and say the same thing in a different
    way?

-   Is your communication successful if the way the person you are
    talking to talks and behaves in a way you expect them to? This
    process was theorised by a sociologist called Talcott Parsons, who
    called it 'Double
    Contingency'[@parsons_social_2012; @luhmann_social_1996]

-   Because social media communicates with thousands of people, your
    communication could be successful with *somebody* among those
    thousands of people even if you don't adjust how you say it.

-   That means that any social media communication may potentially be
    successful with somebody within a networked set of possible
    respondents.

## 5. Social Media Networks and Communication
---------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How does the number of people on social media change the way we
    choose to communicate?

-   How do we decide which media platform we will use to communicate?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The diagram above illustrates the communication challenge of social
    media

-   A *sender* thinks of a message to send over an electronic connection
    which contains 'noise' of different kinds (for example, different
    understandings, different cultures, etc)

-   There are many (millions) of possible receivers

-   Among one or two of those receivers, somebody will understand the
    message and forward it on to an even larger audience.

## 6. Confirmation Bias and Trolling
------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why has social media seen an explosion in online abuse, misogyny,
    racism, trolling, stalking and fake news?

-   What is it about online communication that means that people feel
    free to say things which they wouldn't say face-to-face?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   'Confirmation bias' is the name given to how communications are
    shaped by the communications of others.

-   Social media provides ways in which a very large audience can be
    manipulated with messages which many might disagree with, but which
    get passed around the internet.

-   'Trolling' is a form of abuse which relies on confirmation bias.
    Abusive or thoughtless messages are made because a community exists
    that will approve of them, but also such communities will also
    approve of the disrupting effects of those messages.

-   The selection of audience over utterance or multiple description can
    exacerbate political uncertainty to which institutional structures
    have to react.

-   Sometimes, the reaction of institutions like governments makes the
    uncertainty worse.

## 7. What does technology do?
------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   When somebody invents a new tool, how often does it provide a new
    way of doing something we could have done before?

-   How often does it provide a way of doing something which there was
    no way of doing before?

-   Why does one technology replace another? Why do some technologies
    fail to find users?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Any new technology creates a new option for doing something. A long
    time ago, the only way of moving around would have been to walk, or
    to ride a horse. New options were created by railways, cars, planes
    and so on.

-   It's the same with communicating: once upon a time, we would have to
    have been with the person we are talking to. New options were
    created by writing, printing, the telephone and the internet?
    ![image](techreal.jpg)

-   Today we have bewildering choice: whether to write a letter, an
    email, a tweet, a text, a phone call?

-   Every new option for doing something creates more uncertainty in the
    decision to do something: **Technology creates uncertainty**

-   Technology can also limit our options for acting in certain ways: a
    locked gate or fence can constrain where humans can move in the
    world.

-   Computer systems today present users with 'forms' for them to fill
    in information like your name, address, phone number, password, etc.
    They constrain: **Technology limits options**.

-   Technology like computers do use algorithms to generate new ways of
    looking at the world which without of them we would not have access
    to.

-   **Technology *amplifies* descriptions of the world.**

-   **The computer does all of these three things at once.**


## 8. Technology and Feedback
-----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   In what ways are you like a robot?

-   In what ways are you like a plant?

-   How do you adapt to your environment?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The modern computer was developed in the 1940s as a consequence of
    technological innovations which arose from the Second World War.

-   One of the principles of the modern computer was the concept of
    *feedback*: where a system's outputs are connected to its inputs. It
    was noted that systems with feedback exhibited 'lifelike' behaviour,
    and many scientists were fascinated by this lifelike behaviour right
    at the beginning of the computer's evolution.

-   Today's technologies of AI and Big Data rely on feedback. More
    importantly, most of the techniques and technologies of AI are not
    new, but were invented at the same time as the digital computer - in
    the late 1940s by some of the leading figures of cybernetics: Warren
    McCulloch, Norbert Wiener, John Von Neumann

-   What is new today is that we have wired every human being on the
    planet into an information network, so that the principles of
    intelligence and feedback imagined in the 1940s are now operating on
    human beings within this network.

-   Russian cybernetics and computing started after the death of Stalin,
    who had banned cybernetics because he thought it was anti-communist.
    People like Victor Glushkov were pioneers of computing in Russia.

## 9. Decentralisation
----------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Does the internet have to be made of servers which store files
    accessed by users who type web addresses?

-   What happens when one of those servers (e.g. google) stops working?

-   Is there an alternative way of organising files where they exist
    everywhere, rather than a single place? What are the implications of
    organising things differently?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   When the internet was developed, the idea was that every machine
    should be connected to every other machine, with no central point of
    control.

-   The protocol through which the web works, *Hyper-text Transport
    Protocol* (http), relies on having servers which deliver documents.

-   As the web has evolved, it has reproduced the centralised structure
    of society where corporations and governments have high-profile
    websites. So instead of a free and open web where everyone is equal,
    we have a web dominated by a few corporations.

-   Web decentalisation focuses on how to reduce the burden on single
    servers by spreading files over many servers. It also looks at
    distributing internet access to parts of the world where building
    infrastructure isn't viable like rural areas. It also seeks to
    address citizen worries about surveillance.

-   Blockchain is one form of decentralisation, but there also emerging
    technologies like the Inter-planetary file system
    (<http://ipfs.io>), and a few similar decentralising protocols like
    DAT (<https://datproject.org/>).

-   The hardware to support decentralisation is also developing. The
    Gotenna device (see <https://www.gotenna.com/pages/mesh>) is a small
    radio repeater which carries a signal for 4 miles, and can easily
    form a mesh network with other Gotenna recievers in the
    neighbourhood.

## 10. Blockchain and Bitcoin
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is a currency possible without a central bank?

-   If an institution like a bank can be replaced with technology, what
    about other institutions like universities?

-   If institutions provide trust in a currency, how does technology
    establish an equal degree of trust?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   One of the functions of institutions like banks, universities or
    hospitals is to provide trust in their services. People use the
    institutions because they have trust in the honesty of what the
    institution does.

-   A banknote, for example, usually contains a 'promise' by the bank to
    pay the sum which is written on the paper BitCoin provides a way in
    which trust can be established simply with an algorithm, rather than
    requiring an institution.
    ![image](blockchain.png)

-   Equally important is that the BitCoin algorithm is a distributed
    technology called a *Blockchain* which doesn't store details of
    transactions on any single server.

-   Instead, the Blockchain algorithm is a "chain of digital signatures"
    which act as an open and transparent ledger of transactions in the
    Bitcoin currency [@nakamoto_bitcoin:_nodate]

-   The blockchain has two principal innovations which have ensured that
    the ledger is trusted. Firstly, the entire blockchain - the list of
    all transactions - is distributed and duplicated throughout the
    internet. Secondly, the veracity of the blockchain ledger is assured
    by a process called 'mining'. This is a data-intensive process which
    aims to identify any anomalies in the ledger. Mining serves a dual
    purpose: whilst it ensures the ledger is accurate, it also rewards
    those who find inconsistencies with the creation of new Bitcoins,
    thus tying the mechanism of verification with the control of the
    money supply (a function normally carried out by a central bank)
    [@vigna_cryptocurrency:_2016]


## 11. Artificial Intelligence
-----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How does Google translate work?

-   What might AI be able to do in the future?

-   What will it not be able to do?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Simple machines with feedback can produce life-like phenomena. For a
    long time, people have asked 'Can we build an artificial brain?'

-   In the 1950s and 60s, cybernetics was the emerging discipline within
    which these developments could be considered together.

-   What we now call 'machine learning' also belongs to this period.
    Machine learning has its roots in the work of one of the pioneers of
    early cybernetics, Warren McCulloch. McCulloch saw that the neural
    structures of the brain were multiple interconnections. In
    describing the logic of this structure, McCulloch coined the term
    'heterarchy'.

-   Neural networks have many interconnected nodes and these can be
    trained to identify the different characteristics of "a thing to be
    recognised". For example, if we want a neural network to recognise a
    picture of a rabbit, the network is exposed to many pictures of
    rabbits (a training set). With enough pictures, it learns the
    characteristics of 'rabbit-ness' from these so that new images of
    rabbits can be successfully identified.

-   Google Translate works in a similar way: it has millions of examples
    of text in different languages which it feeds into its neural
    network. That learns how to convert one to the other. It also learns
    from the preferences of users when they use it.

-   Machine learning depends on having thousands of items to train it.
    If thousands of items are not available, machine learning is
    unlikely to be very good.

Google has an open source machine learning project called TensorFlow,
with many examples of machine learning: <https://www.tensorflow.org/>

There are some impressive demos of machine learning in the arts as part
of the Magenta project: <https://magenta.tensorflow.org/demos>


## 12. Surveillance and Big Data
-------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How much does Facebook, VK, Whatsapp or your internet service
    provider know about you?

-   Is it a problem that technology companies know so much about you?

-   Is it a problem that governments might know so much about you?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Everything we do online records data which is sent back to the
    providers of online services we use.

-   Providers of online services adapt the service they provide to us
    based on what they know about us: so if you shop on amazon for
    something, you will receive adverts for that thing in other web
    pages. ![image](cambridgeanalytica.jpg)

-   This recording of personal data is unprecedented in human history:
    it is not the 'connectedness' of people that is new with the
    internet (we have always been interconnected as human beings); it is
    the capacity for the strategic organisation, recall and manipulation
    of data about humans to then change the behaviour of humans.

-   The collection of personal data is related to the centralisation of
    the internet. If the internet was decentralised, then personal data
    could be stored under the control of the individual who creates it.

-   Individuals could then sell their own data to corporations if they
    wished.

-   The Cambridge Analytica scandal recently showed how personal data is
    being used by large corporations for commercial and political
    advantages.

## 13. Attenuations
------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What would you rather share: your Facebook/VK password or your
    toothbrush?

-   In what ways do computers present you with barriers to doing things?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Technology forces us to behave in certain ways, demanding use of
    electronic forms, passwords, user permissions, firewalls and so on.

-   The earliest example of the *form* was developed during the first
    world war. *Form A2042* was the name given to the 'Field Service
    Post Card', upon which soldiers could send brief messages home by
    crossing-out the options which did not apply. Paul Fussell claims it
    was

    > 'the progenitor of of all modern forms on which you fill in things
    > or cross out things or check off things, from police traffic
    > summonses to "questionnaires" and income-tax blanks.'
    > [@fussell_great_2013]

-   The Field Service Post-Card is an attenuator which reinforces
    control by a central authority or hierarchy (in this case, the
    British army). The form's restricted structure prevented soldiers
    saying too much.

-   Hierarchies maintain themselves by attenuating the flow of
    information between themselves and their environment.

    ![image](a2042.jpg)

-   Today's computer forms do more than attenuate the communication of
    individuals. Computer tools also *amplify* the patterns of behaviour
    gained by capturing many people engaging with the form. Modern
    computer technology can dynamically adapt the constraints within
    which users engage with the system.

-   social media platforms present content to users which in a way where
    the behaviour of users might be anticipated.

Technology and Business
=======================

## 76. Business
--------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What has technology done to business?

-   What is the difference between the way businesses used to manage
    their transactions in the past and the way they do now?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   New technologies are themselves the result of entrepreneurial firms,
    reducing transaction costs for access to the means of reducing
    transaction costs. It is in this corporate provision of services to
    individuals who seek to reduce their transaction costs in other ways
    that we find today's internet giants.

-   Most of us make transactions in many different domains and engage
    with many different kinds of institution. Over the internet and
    social software, the way transactions are made, the kinds of
    organisations they are made with, the way they are tracked and
    recorded has all been transformed. According to Coase, and later the
    "New Institutionalism"[@powell_new_1991] theorists, whilst the human
    action of transacting is constitutive of the institutions through
    which transactions are exchanged, patterns of communicative
    transactions across different industries can lead to dynamics
    whereby management functions within institutions become coordinated
    in what DiMaggio and Powell identify as 'institutional isomorphism'.
    The basic mechanisms of transaction management have in various ways
    led to the specialised discourses of what has generally been termed
    'managerialism'.


## 77. Social Media's Management of Transactions
-----------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why are we addicted to social media?

-   Is the addiction of the population to social in the commercial
    interests of social media companies?

-   How can the social media companies ensure that we continue to be
    addicted?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   When we use social media, we have the impression that we are talking
    to our friends or to a community. It is less obvious that we are
    also talking to the social media company itself.

-   These exchanges with friends and with the media companies are
    'transactions'. This implies some kind of exchange. On social media,
    users exchange their personal data for the services that the social
    media companies provide. ![image](socmed.jpg)

-   Social media companies require these transactions in order to make a
    profit. Their job is to manipulate the context within which
    exchanges or transactions are taking place so that users continue to
    make them.

-   The diagram above shows how the exchanges between users occur in
    contexts which are continually manipulated by the social media
    companies based on their analysis of the data which is exchanged
    between users.

-   Social media 'addiction' is, to some extent, 'engineered' since it
    is in the corporate interests of the social media company.


## 78. Viable Systems
--------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the difference between a living system like a bee-hive and a
    business?

-   Are there common organising principles which unite all living
    things?

-   Are there common organisational dangers which can lead to the death
    of any living thing?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Beer's Viable System Model (VSM) describes multiple levels of
    organisation in an organism in an environment. Each level is a kind
    of conversion of one form of information into another: what is
    called a 'transduction'

-   In the VSM, five 'regulating mechanisms' are specified whose job is
    to maintain the viability of the whole entity. The purpose of the
    system is to manage complexity, which is measured by how much
    'variety' the system possesses. Beer explains that "the regulator
    has to be capable of generating a variety equivalent to the variety
    that has to be regulated -- or the regulator will fail".
    [@beer_heart_1995].

-   An organism's variety is managed in relation to the variety of its
    environment. Typically, the environment is more complex (has higher
    variety) than the organism.

-   If the variety of the environment overwhelms the system, then the
    system is at risk of collapse through unmanageable oscillation
    (competing for resources) amongst the system's components. The
    viable system must attenuate the variety of the environment and
    amplify its own operations in order to ensure viable operation.

    ![image](VSM.jpg)

-   The different regulating systems are:

    -   System 1: the components which actually 'do the work' on the
        ground: the meaningful different activities that a business has
        to do.

    -   System 2: is responsible for ensuring that the different
        activities of system 1 do not conflict with each other.

    -   System 3: is responsible for ensuring adequate resources are
        provided to the different components in system 1. It is
        responsible for 'operational management'

    -   System 4: is responsible for 'strategic management'. It's role
        is to inspect the environment of the system and look for threats
        and opportunities, instructing system 3 about what might need to
        change

    -   System 5: is responsible for maintaining the balance between
        system 3 and system 4. In doing so, it maintains the identity of
        the whole system.

-   Beer's VSM is a recursive model. Each element in system 1 has
    exactly the same form (systems 1 - 5) as the higher level system
    that contains it.

-   You can imagine the VSM mapped on to a person:

    -   System 1 represents all the daily things that you do.. talking
        to people, using technology, reading this, and so on.

    -   System 2 represents the rules that you use to ensure that all
        the things that you do do not conflict with one another. This is
        a bit like a schedule or a to-do list.

    -   System 3 represents planning for the tasks ahead: making sure
        you have the equipment you need, enough time, and so on.

    -   System 4 represents your thinking about possible threats and
        opportunities in the future. System 4 is about imagination and
        dreams for the future. It has to talk to System 3 to tell it how
        System 3 might need to reprioritise things.

    -   System 5 is your identity, it maintains a balance of the other
        systems in the environment so that you present a coherent
        statement of who you are to others.


## 79. Cool tools: Keep Clicking!
--------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why are there more and more cool things on the internet?

-   Why does Facebook, Twitter, VK, etc want you to keep clicking on
    cool tools?

-   Is fake news driven by politics or is it driven by the commercial
    requirements of platform companies to maintain user transactions?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   'Cool' tools increase the transaction count in ways which users are
    not aware. This is particularly true of online gaming platforms,
    fitness trackers, AI Bots and new technological experiences like
    Virtual Reality. In these cases, tiny transactions of data feeds
    give information about aspects of behaviour which users themselves
    are unaware: the movement of the head and eyes in virtual reality, a
    person's heart rate, location information, particular phrases used
    by people talking to a Bot, or learning processes as a game player
    solves a puzzle. In each case, the data can be harvested. Since
    users are increasingly operating within the defined constraints of
    online platforms, the data can help adjust those constraints in
    particular ways so as to steer behaviour. Machine learning can
    record patterns of interaction and make inferences about behaviour
    to steer users towards serving the needs of the corporations who
    provide the communications services.

-   The economics behind the 'fun' of new 'cool' technology drives
    continual innovation online. Every week, we see news of some new
    technology that facilitates new forms of interaction: it might be a
    new computer game, or some new service for translation (like Google
    translate's magical ability to automatically identify text in images
    and translate it), or a new feature in SnapChat, or voice-activated
    devices like Amazon's echo, or Virtual reality, or a new phone app.
    One of the exciting things about technology is that we struggle to
    imagine what will become possible next year.

-   Every innovation is the same in the sense that every innovation
    seeks to engage users in interaction. Without interaction, without
    increased transactions, the innovation dies alongside its corporate
    infrastructure.

-   It is only through the transactions with a company's services that
    the company exists. And it is only by harvesting the data from those
    transactions that the company can make profits. The online service
    company has to create the conditions for the exchange of many
    transactions and use the intelligence it gathers from those
    transactions to:

    1.  provide targeted advertising services;

    2.  provide analytic services to other corporate clients;

    3.  steer user behaviour by constraining the information environment
        in the platform in directions which favour corporate clients;

    4.  steer the userbase of the platform into new practices and
        services which increase their engagement and broaden the
        network.


## 80. Hierarchies
-----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Do we need kings, presidents, bosses and institutions?

-   How might the world look if there was no hierarchy?

-   Does technology want to do what an institution does?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Universities, churches, schools, armies, governments, corporations
    and scout groups, are organised hierarchically. That means there is
    a boss at the top (a high-priest, king, vice-chancellor, president,
    rector) and there are departments below them, each with a head, and
    under each division there are divisional-heads, with umpteen
    sub-divisions under them, when finally there are individual workers
    whose function is to ensure that their divisional head can't be
    blamed for anything.

-   Human hierarchies serve multiple functions. They codify the division
    of labour within an organisation, they provide a structure for
    managing complexity of an organisation, and - perhaps most
    importantly - they provide 'lines of responsibility' which
    apportions credit and blame to different members of an organisation
    when their sections either succeed or fail.

-   Because of this, they also serve to maintain a degree of conformity
    with the standards and expectation of the person at the top of the
    hierarchy. In a University, hierarchy also reinforces the
    structuring of knowledge as it has emerged through the curriculum.

-   Those at the top of hierarchies can make declarations about what
    becomes real for others in the organisation: the president can
    declare new laws, the head of a university can declare new rules for
    examinations, and so on.

-   Hierarchies also declare that some things are scarce: for example, a
    bank declares that money is scarce, and in so doing, it upholds its
    value.


## 81. Attenuation in Hierarchies
--------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How much information about an organisation can the boss absorb?

-   How much information is lost in the process of reporting what is
    actually happening in a business?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The underlying principle of hierarchy is *attenuation*. Highly
    complex phenomena carries a rich variety of descriptions which has
    to be squeezed to single description summaries of 'what is going on'
    that the senior management team can absorb.

-   In any institutional hierarchy, this attenuation works both in a
    'vertical' way, from the bottom of an organisation to the top, and
    in a 'horizontal' way, whereby each individual has to attenuate the
    complexity of the totality of the environment within which they
    live. Since each individual is every other individual's environment,
    any organisation features horizontal attenuation at all levels
    between all individuals. Figure
    [[fig:hierarchyattenuate]](#fig:hierarchyattenuate){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:hierarchyattenuate"} shows the patterns of
    attenuation and the division of knowledge in the institutional
    structure.

    ![The attenuations of
    hierarchy[]{label="fig:hierarchyattenuate"}](Slide5){#fig:hierarchyattenuate
    width="columnwidth"}

-   This diagram is however, simplistic. Humans, like other animals,
    shape their environment to suit themselves. From the attenuation of
    the environment to simple organisational principles, humans amplify
    these organisational principles by making changes to their
    environment such that their organising principles provide a reliable
    way of coordinating themselves. This action to shape the environment
    represents the opposite of attenuation: it is an amplification of an
    individual's understanding of their environment.

-   In modern organisations, the attenuation process from bottom to top,
    and from the environment to the individual, is driven by
    *information*: data on everything from class attendance, student
    surveys, pass rates and student fee income is collected and
    processed to assist organisational decision-making. Impressive
    though this range of data is, and hypnotic our modern data analytic
    software, such information is always constraint - it is always a
    tool of attenuation. What gets left out? Unfortunately, what is left
    out often reveals itself as a menacing force appearing from nowhere
    which produces sudden shocks to hierarchies. Such is the story of
    most recent institutional crises from the financial collapse of
    banks and corporations, child abuse in the church, illegal behaviour
    of journalists, health scandals, abuse of power by Hollywood moguls
    and the expenses of politicians.


## 82. Are Hierarchies Sustainable in a world of Uncertainty?
------------------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Do institutional hierarchies contribute to the conditions that might
    threaten them?

-   Are there alternative forms of organisation which are not
    hierarchical?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Many human hierarchical organisations have experienced shocks and
    crises of confidence in recent years (for example, child abuse in
    the Catholic church, scandals in the press, government scandals,
    corporate failures). In some cases, these institutions appear out of
    control.

-   These scandals are 'shocks' from the environment to which the
    institution has to respond. Their effect is to reveal that the
    environment within which the institution thought it was operating
    with some certainty, suddenly turns out to be *uncertain*.

-   Institutions respond to this uncertainty with bureaucratic
    processes: there are inquiries, restructures, people responsible are
    identified and removed, and so on. The effect and the motivation of
    these processes is to preserve the institution's structure. The
    critically important thing is that most institutions have to react
    to environmental uncertainties which they themselves create! How
    does this happen?

    Figure
     [[fig:uncertaininstitution]](#fig:uncertaininstitution){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:uncertaininstitution"} shows the dynamic relationship
    between environmental uncertainty and the institution's response to
    it as a positive feedback loop.

    ![The positive feedback between institutional hierarchy and an
    increasingly uncertain
    environment[]{label="fig:uncertaininstitution"}](Slide8){#fig:uncertaininstitution
    width="columnwidth"}

-   Hierarchies are uncommon in nature: the natural world is
    *ecological*, where differences between elements which might appear
    to be in a hierarchy (say, the levels of the food chain) are
    interlinked in ways which mean that domination by one level over
    another leads to catastrophe.

-   Equally, the brain is not the boss of the body. The body comprises
    multiple components which work together coordinated by signals
    passed through the central nervous system.

-   In the natural world, in place of hierarchy, we see circularity.
    This is because natural structures seek viability and adaptability
    in response to a changing environment. Circular organisational
    structures help achieve this through continual organic adaptation.



## 83. Predicting Technology
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How can we predict the 'next thing' in technology?

-   What do computers do to organisations and society?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   To understand the potential social impact of technology is to
    understand the relationship between technology and institutions.
    Both technology and institutions mediate transactions between
    people. In both cases, this mediation is conducted against a
    background of risk.

-   Predictions about the impact of technology can be made in two ways.
    On the one hand, we can seek to establish trends from a wide variety
    of observed phenomena. This approach is called 'synthetic'.
    Alternatively, we can analyse the deeper underlying mechanisms which
    produce today's phenomena, and to draw out from those mechanisms the
    phenomena which might present us tomorrow. This approach is called
    'analytic'.

-   An example of a successful analytical approach to technology
    prediction is contained in Winograd and Flores's book "Understanding
    computers and cognition", which was published in 1986
    [@winograd_understanding_1986] Winograd and Flores sought to
    identify the underlying mechanisms which produced the technology of
    their time using cybernetic analysis and philosophy. Their
    conclusion was strongly critical of the prevailing 'synthetic'
    understanding of technology in the pre-internet age that computers
    were about data processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Whilst
    the superficial appearances of technology suggested that AI and data
    indicated the future, Winograd and Flores's analytical approach
    identified human communication as the domain of fundamental
    transformation by computers in 1986, and which, they argued, would
    continue to be changed in the future (this was before the Worldwide
    Web)

-   Within a few years it became obvious that they were right. The
    'workflow' technology which they pioneered on the back of their
    philosophical and technological critique became one of the major
    components of corporate IT communications infrastructure.

-   Their argument was that computers were both constructed *in
    langauge* and were tools *of language* focused on the 'speech acts'
    which are performed through computers (drawing on the Speech act
    theory of Austin and Searle).

-   Computers recorded speech acts, and through them the commitments
    which human beings make to each other - those exchanges which are
    critical to the establishment of trust between human beings - can be
    managed and tracked, even to the point that eventually

    > New computer-based communication technology can help anticipate
    > and avoid breakdowns ... we can partially anticipate situations
    > where breakdowns are likely to occur (by noting their recurrence)
    > and we can provide people with the tools and procedures they need
    > to cope with them. Moreover, new conversational networks can be
    > designed that give the organisation the ability to recognise and
    > realise new possibilities. [@winograd_understanding_1986]

-   The fact that the computer kept a *record* of all the speech acts
    that everyone made was for Winograd and Flores the critical issue.
    Curiously, despite their anti-AI stance, this basic idea of storing
    and analysing speech acts lies behind what we now consider to be the
    major achievements of modern AI: social media on the internet
    provides the 'big data' from which data mining techniques identify
    precisely what Winograd and Flores were articulating: Ways of
    anticipating - and potentially avoiding - breakdown.


## 84. Transactions and Institutions
-----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the role of institutions in brokering the transactions
    between individuals?

-   What is technology doing to the management of transactions in
    businesses?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The impact of computers on most industries, from retail to finance,
    has been an ever-increasing atomisation of transaction processing
    alongside ever more sophisticated means of orchestrating different
    transaction processing services.

-   The relationship between transactions and institutions was first
    studied in the 1930s in the economic work of Ronald
    Coase[@coase_firm_1990]. In developing his theory, Coase argued that
    economics was upside-down. It concentrated on the means for
    producing economic outcomes, but ignored the social entities through
    which the means and ends of economics were negotiated. Coase
    highlighted that there was in economics no questioning about the
    existence of markets, banks, firms, governments and so on. His
    suggestion was to see that social entities like markets were created
    through the transactions which individuals created with them:

    > the operation of a market costs something and by forming an
    > organisation and allowing some authority (an "entrepreneur") to
    > direct the resources, certain marketing costs are saved. The
    > entrepreneur has to carry out his function at less cost, taking
    > into account the fact that he may get factors of production at a
    > lower price than the market transactions which he supersedes,
    > because it is always possible to revert to the open market if he
    > fails to do this. [@coase_firm_1990]

-   The establishment of an institution like a market arose because the
    cost of transactions between a seller and their customers could be
    reduced by the entrepreneurial creation of an entity to broker
    exchange between individuals. Coase goes on to discuss the role of
    technology in facilitating transactions:

    > Inventions which tend to bring factors of production nearer
    > together, by lessening spatial distribution, tend to increase the
    > size of the firm. Changes like the telephone and the telegraph
    > which tend to reduce the cost of organising spatially will tend to
    > increase the size of the firm.


## 85. Social Media Corporate Value
----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why does Facebook's share price drop if it loses users?

-   What does Facebook have to do to keep and increase users?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The fall in the number of transactions which Twitter experienced has
    had a significant effect on Twitter's share
    price[@noauthor_twitter_2016]. Equally, the price demanded by
    Snapchat is dependent on the number of transactions which it
    produces. This is the essential index of the 'coolness' of the
    technology [@noauthor_snapchat_2017].

-   Each social media corporation seeks to increase the transactions its
    customers have. The conventional rationale for maintaining this is
    that whilst customers are contributing transactions to the
    corporations they are more likely to see advertising.

-   Through making useful distinctions between pay-by-click links and
    free links, companies can create the conditions where some
    transactions (and eventually those transactions which lead to income
    generation) become more likely.

-   The challenge for Social Media companies is always to increase the
    number of transactions that individuals have with their services.
    They can do this in many ways, partly by manipulating the items
    which appear to users to align with their preferences, and partly by
    innovating new tools and services which encourage people to click
    more.

## 86. Trust and the Algorithm
-----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why do you trust Google, Facebook, VK, Amazon?

-   What would be the consequences of a loss of trust in the security of
    shopping online?

-   Does trust have to be in an institution? Can it be in an algorithm?

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Customer trust is critical to all businesses. If customers lose
    trust in a company, it goes out of business.

-   The web has been used as a tool for the coordination of contracts
    between buyers and sellers since the dot-com boom of the early
    2000s. This has relied on the establishment of trust in online
    payments.

    ![image](rouble.jpg)

-   Trust on the internet is managed by algorithms which encode credit
    card details and other information in forms which mean that these
    details remain private. Imagine if the cryptographic keys which
    maintain trust in online payments are hacked, and no online payments
    could be secure anymore. What would be the implications?

-   Although we think we trust companies like Paypal or Mastercard,
    really we are putting our trust in these cryptographic algorithms.

-   Algorithms of trust do not need to be centralised around a
    particular company. Bitcoin is a cyptographic algorithm without any
    kind of institution or business to uphold its value.

-   The same principle which upholds trust in Bitcoin can be used to
    uphold trust in other services like selling goods, hotels, taxis,
    travel, etc.

-   In the future we may see individuals trusting algorithmic processes
    themselves, rather than institutions which use those processes.
    Sometimes, the operation of algorithms themselves is clearer and
    more transparent than the operation of businesses.

-   In the future, we may see This is leading to what people are calling
    the 'decentralised web', where contractual exchanges between
    individuals are coordinated through algorithms rather than through
    brokers.


## 87. Worldwide Web Decentralisation and Institutions
-----------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why is centralisation of the worldwide web a problem?

-   What might decentralisation mean for businesses?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   When Tim Berners-Lee invented the worldwide web, he envisaged a
    platform which would remove barriers of access to information and
    overcome the limitations of hierarchical structures in institutions.

-   What's actually happened to the worldwide web is that it has
    reproduced institutional hierarchies, and now the internet is
    dominated by a handful of (mostly American) companies: Google,
    Facebook, etc.

-   This has also produced problems in terms of privacy and data
    management, and user worries about surveillance.

-   The reasons why this has happened are partly technical and partly to
    do with trust. Technically, the internet relies on a protocol called
    *Hypertext Transport Protocol* (http) which identifies individual
    servers as the source of files and gives them a name. When we type
    "google.com" we are accessing files on Google's server's.

-   Because results from Google become trusted, more and more people use
    Google, giving them more data, and increasing their market value.

-   Web decentralisation works by not storing files on particular
    servers, but rather distributing files and servers across many
    machines in the internet.

-   The location of a file is no longer a particular server, but a code
    which reassembles the file from many different machines.

-   What this means is that the transactions of users are no longer with
    a particular company which acts as a broker, but with specific files
    which are distributed. Potentially this can disrupt centralised
    businesseses because they no longer control access to files: files
    are distributed.

Intersubjectivity
=================

## 39. Consciousness
-------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How can consciousness talk about consciousness? How can a brain
    describe a brain?

-   How could the presence of a mind-independent reality be proved?

-   Is our mind in our head? Where else might it be?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The founder of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl, realised that in order
    to study consciousness it was impossible to escape the problem that
    whatever an *individual* consciousness was (and the very idea of
    *individual* is problematic) the consciousness of one mind was
    *relative* to another.

-   Husserl considered the idea of consciousness *between* people, or
    what he called *intersubjectivity*. He argued that consciousness
    emerged between minds in a shared environment, or 'lifeworld'.

-   Husserl was primarily focused on the structure of consciousness and
    his idea of intersubjectivity was framed around the face-to-face
    interaction between two people. Broader relations to society,
    contemporaries and ancestors were not considered.

-   However, consciousness is between people face-to-face, and between
    people who are not with us immediately, with material objects in the
    world (like computers), and maybe even between the minds of the
    living and the minds of dead (how could we know?)

-   Often neuroscience identifies the mind inside the head: in doing so,
    it presupposes an objective world of 'mind' beyond the mind that
    makes the observation through MRI scanners!


## 40. Consciousness and Intersubjectivity
-----------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is consciousness in between people analyzable?

-   How conscious are you now?

-   What are the observable features of consciousness?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Alfred Schutz made a connection between Husserl's intersubjectivity
    and Weber's sociology. Weber, in defining sociology as "a science
    concerning itself with the interpretive understanding of social
    action and thereby with a causal explanation of its course and
    consequences" [@weber_economy_1978] lacked a theory of human
    understanding, and didn't go into much detail about the ways in
    which human communication occurs.

-   Schutz saw Husserl's attempt to describe intersubjectivity as a
    corrective to this: a comprehensive theory of mind that could be
    united with a theory of social life. However, Schutz felt that
    Husserl's account of intersubjectivity was deficient since Husserl's
    main focus in considering intersubjectivity is one-to-one close
    relations, and ignores the broader dimension of what Schutz called
    the "world of others".

-   world of others, according to Schutz, involves a range of different
    kinds of intersubjective relations, from intimate face-to-face
    relations, to distance relations with 'contemporaries'.

-   The online world presents a clear distinction between face-to-face
    engagement and more distant relations. Schutz himself distinguished
    between between face-to-face engagement, or what he called a "pure
    we-relation", and engagement at a distance. He identified what he
    called a 'spectrum of vividness', arguing that the difference
    between the face-to-face world and what he calls the "world of
    contemporaries" can be illustrated by the experience of ending a
    face-to-face encounter:


## 41. Communication and Expectation
-----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Can you communicate with someone if you have no idea of what they
    think?

-   When you email somebody, who are you talking to?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The sociologist Talcott Parsons sought to develop Schutz's ideas
    about expectation into a more systematic theory of human
    communication, arguing that what happens in communication was a
    process of what he calls '*double
    contingency*'[@parsons_social_2012]. $A$'s expectations of $B$'s
    behaviour in response to $A$'s utterances are mirrored by $B$'s
    expectations of $A$ behaviour to $B$'s utterances. In an extended
    correspondence between them, Parsons and Schutz wrestle between a
    systematic and systems-theoretical characterisation of communication
    (which was what Parsons sought) and a phenomenological and more
    subtle characterisation of the development of consciousness in
    communication (which Schutz was aiming for) [@grathoff_theory_1978].

-   What Schutz refers to as a "decreasing number of perceptions"
    suggests that each of the sensory 'channels' which carry alternative
    descriptions of the encounter are degraded with distance. What is
    constructed from these multiple descriptions is, Schutz suggests (in
    line with Husserl), a set of expectations about the communication
    situation without which the making of utterances would be
    impossible. In other words, I can only write these words now because
    I have some expectation of the experience of you as a reader.

-   The meaning of my words is therefore dependent on the coordination
    of expectations between people who communicate: Husserl called these
    sets of expectations 'horizons of meaning', and so it can be said
    that what is communicated are not words but expectations or
    meanings.

-   Schutz does not suggest that the process of 'coordinating
    expectations' does *not* happen at a distance, but he does suggest
    that the mechanisms by which meanings are established and
    coordinated between people are different in the situation where
    there is face-to-face contact, and where there is no physical
    co-presence.

-   Schutz's analysis presents some fascinating questions: might he say
    that a 'pure we-relation' is still possible at a distance using a
    medium of communication (say Skype) which does not decrease the
    number of perceptions?

## 42. Dialogue and Listening
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What happens when we listen somebody carefully?

-   After listening, how do we formulate a response?

-   Can we teach people to listen better?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Dialogue involves listening to a greater extent than it does talking

-   In dialogue there is not necessarily a free choice of talking: what
    is said is said in the context of what is understood by what is
    heard by others.

-   Dialogue articulates a structure which has many levels: a
    conversations about an object produces a conversation about the
    conversation about the object, or a conversation about the
    conversation about the conversation about an object. These different
    levels of discourse shift over time. What emerges are different
    discrete strata of construction.

-   David Bohm believed that at its best, dialogue reflected deeper
    structures in the universe. The multiple strata of patterns of
    engagement in dialogue help us to perceive something deeper.

-   Objects can help with the process of dialogue. When an object is
    presented (for example a photograph), it invites many different
    descriptions from different people. When these descriptions are
    brought together, it produces a richer picture not just of the
    object, but of the different people who makes descriptions about it.

-   Teachers are particularly skilled in generating multiple
    descriptions of the same thing. The process of teaching is a process
    of generating redundancy: the teacher may say "think about it like
    this", or "here's an example", or "let me tell you a story about
    this", or "What do you think?" (which is an invitation to multiple
    descriptions produced by others.

-   Encouraging people to listen requires encouraging people to see the
    importance of multiple descriptions of things rather than being
    focused on a single 'correct' description. Science is partly to
    blame for presenting the world in a single description. Modern
    physics actually tells us that this isn't how things are.


## 43. Unhappiness
-----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How do childhood relationships with parents affect us in adult life?

-   What is the relation between ourselves and our environment which
    makes us unhappy?

-   What are the factors which help alleviate unhappiness?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Unhappiness may have a systemic explanation. In the study of animal
    behaviour, it became clear that the relationship between mothers and
    babies was a systemic relation. If mothers were separated from
    babies, then the result was distress.

-   Konrad Lorenz, who was the pioneer of this work, projected his
    findings on to the human world:

    > The competition between human beings destroys with cold and
    > diabolic brutality... Under the pressure of this competitive fury
    > we have not only forgotten what is useful to humanity as a whole,
    > but even that which is good and advantageous to the individual.
    > [...] One asks, which is more damaging to modern humanity: the
    > thirst for money or consuming haste... in either case, fear plays
    > a very important role: the fear of being overtaken by one's
    > competitors, the fear of becoming poor, the fear of making wrong
    > decisions or the fear of not being up to snuff...
    > [@lorenz_aggression_2002]

-   In Lorenz's work with geese, he noticed how the movement of chicks
    maintained proximity to the mother. He called this mechanism of
    maintaining proximity 'imprinting' and explored its parameters by
    replacing real mothers with a wire-frame model which was presented
    to the chicks within hours of hatching: as a consequence, the baby
    chicks maintained proximity to this object as if it was the mother.
    It was a cybernetic experiment where theoretical models and
    empirical evidence combined convincingly.

-   Does this suggest that emotions such as unhappiness, grief, anger
    have their roots in the systemic relation between the child and the
    parent? More broadly, it may suggest that the relationship between
    the organism and the environment is the critical determiner of
    emotion.

-   If this is the case, then it suggests that issues of experience of
    emotion have a connection to political issues in the social
    environment: what R.D. Laing calls the 'Politics of Experience'
    [@laing_politics_1990]

 
## 44. Attachment: The roots of emotion in childhood
---------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the child's tie to its mother as a systemic relation?

-   Why does disruption to the child's relationship with its mother lead
    to psychological trauma later in life?

-   Can deep emotional issues be understood in terms of abstract
    systems?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   John Bowlby stated that " the child's tie to his mother is a product
    of the activity of a number of behavioural systems that have
    proximity to mother as a predictable outcome."

-   He suggested that "young children, who for whatever reason are
    deprived of the continuous care and attention of a mother or a
    substitute-mother, are not only temporarily disturbed by such
    deprivation, but may in some cases suffer long-term effects which
    persist" [@bowlby_effects_1956]

-   Bowlby called his mechanism 'attachment' and expressed it in
    cybernetic terms: "What principles of organisation are necessary if
    behaviour is to attain these ends?". In stating his organisational
    principle, Bowlby sets the stage for an analysis of personality
    arising from mechanisms of early life relations and the
    organisational dynamics of development. He focused particularly on
    the relationship between the child and the mother - although the
    issue is really about the principal caregiver of whichever sex.

-   The demonstration of the thesis demanded attention on what happened
    if the proximity to the mother is *not* a predictable outcome. What
    happened where the mother or father rejected the child's affection,
    or attachments were affected by death or drastic changes in
    circumstance? In exploring this, Bowlby turns to some of the
    fundamental problems of psychoanalysis.

-   The consequence of this view was that human behaviour had to be
    studied *relationally*. Humans were not individuals, but
    inter-connected systems: recent research work of addiction supports
    his findings. [@flores_addiction_2011].


## 45. Facilitating Learning
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How do you become a facilitator of discussion rather than a
    possessor of knowledge?

-   What is Personal Intellectual Transformation?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   During the communicative process, complex theoretical problems are
    put forward and solved, scientific material is analyzed, the
    positions of various scientific schools are compared, disputable
    points are identified and clarified.

-   The communication between students and the teacher makes it possible
    to build scientific information in a single harmonious system, to
    highlight the main points in it, to reveal the position in the proof
    analysis, and to help students to critically comprehend the proposed
    factual material, to realize and evaluate it, highlighting the most
    necessary and discarding the secondary.

-   The content of communication is information that the teacher offers
    students through various communication tools. However, the essence
    of communication is not limited to information exchange. To ensure
    that the content of the discipline has been assimilated by students
    at a high level, it is necessary, along with pedagogical tasks, to
    set and solve communicative tasks.

-   In teaching, we choose the most effective methods of communication
    and on their basis to organize productive communication between the
    teacher and the student.

-   Successful communication is facilitated by the use of information
    products and pedagogical technologies aimed at activating students'
    thinking. Typically, experienced teachers intuitively use in their
    work a synthesis of elements of creative learning.

-   To encourage students to think, documenting experiences and
    reflections helps to expand the field of inquiry through the
    consistent formulation of the set of questions "Why?" (Similar to
    curiosity in childhood), and helps to identify cause and effect
    relationships, helping to better understand the subject of research
    and plunge into the research problem.


## 46. Risk and Anxiety
----------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What are you worried about?

-   Do we worry about more things than our parents did?

-   Do technological advances create more things to worry about?

-   Is anxiety evenly distributed in society?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   German Sociologist Ulrich Beck argued that we now live in a 'risk
    society', where risks are manufactured both in the creation of new
    technologies, and in the creation of new risks in the law, the
    economy, and education.

-   Beck argues that the distribution of risks is not even: those at the
    bottom of society are subject to far more risks, with far fewer
    means of addressing them, than those at the top.

-   He argues that there is a connection between risk and education:
    that new technologies create new requirements to learn to use new
    tools, which increases the risk of not being qualified.

-   Furthermore, Beck argues that education itself becomes a risk:

    > "Everywhere educational reform is accompanied by a dependence on
    > education. More and more groups get caught up in the race for
    > educational credentials. As a result there emerge new internal
    > differentiations. Whilst these may still respond to traditional
    > differences between groups, the impact of education makes them
    > fundamentally different from traditional ones. [...] In
    > conjunction with novel patterns of upward and downward mobility
    > and increasing local labour mobility as well, new hierarchies and
    > differentiations develop which are internal to social classes.
    > They presuppose the expansion of the service sector and the
    > creation of new occupations."[@beck_risk_1992]

## 47. Constructs
----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Are the words you use to describe the world the same as the words
    others use to describe the world?

-   Do you mean the same things by the words you use as others do when
    they use the same words?

-   Do the words we use to describe the world reveal how the world is,
    or how we are?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   We use words to describe our reality, and reality appears
    differently to each of us.

-   Whilst this doesn't mean that reality *is* simply language, it does
    emphasise that the words we use form an important part of the fabric
    of the world through which we have to find our way.

-   Finding our way in the world is not something we do alone: we have
    to communicate with other people. That means that we have to
    coordinate our understandings of the words we use with the
    understandings of words by others.

-   George Kelly's 'Personal Construct Theory' is an approach to
    analysing the different ways individuals construct their reality by
    analysing the different words they use in different circumstances.

-   For example, if I was to classify 'cakes', I might think of a
    variety of ways of describing and categorising them, including
    "sweet", "fluffy", "heavy", "fruity", and so on.

-   The way I use those words may differ from the way other people might
    use them: so, given a set of cakes, how I categorise them may be
    different to how others categorise them.

-   The value of doing Personal Construct analysis is it opens up a
    broader conversation about where distinctions really lie, and how
    different people with different distinctions can coordinate
    themselves.
